            "But there’s a way to get SGBs at a discounted price.\n",
            "After the issue is over, RBI lists Sovereign Gold Bonds on stock exchanges. Now, many times, these old issues trade at a discount. If you are lucky, you can get a discount of 1% to 6%.\n",
            "But before you rush to buy these old gold bonds, there are a few things that you need to understand.\n",
            "And that’s what we will talk about today.\n",
            "This article is divided into 3 sections.\n",
            "A quick introduction to SGBs\n",
            "We will discuss buying and selling SGBs on stock exchanges in detail. And its pros and cons.\n",
            "We will compare older and new issues to help you pick the right one.\n",
            "What Are Sovereign Gold Bonds?\n",
            "Sovereign gold bonds were introduced by the government in 2015.\n",
            "Although the returns on these bonds are pegged to gold prices, no actual gold is backing them.\n",
            "Yes, you read it right. There is no underlying gold in the case of sovereign gold bonds.\n",
            "It’s a bond that is pegged to gold prices and has a sovereign guarantee.\n",
            "So, at maturity, the redemption happens as per the prevailing gold prices.\n",
            "For example, you invest today at Rs 5,900 per gram.\n",
            "After eight years, the bond matures. At that time, the gold price is Rs 12,000 per gram.\n",
            "The government will pay you around Rs 12,000 for one unit of SGB on maturity (The actual maturity price is a simple average of gold price for the previous three business days).\n",
            "From time to time, the government comes up with SGB issues, and one can invest in SGBs online or offline during such occasions through banks, designated post offices, and the Stock Holding Corporation of India.\n",
            "SGBs have an eight-year tenure. But it’s not that you have to hold onto your SGBs for 8 years. You can redeem them after five years as well.\n",
            "The RBI announces the early redemption windows from time to time.\n",
            "Further, if a user buys SGB from the bank, they can get it dematerialized and sell it on the secondary market if they want to sell it prematurely.\n",
            "Now as you can sell SGBs on stock exchanges, similarly you can even invest in them through exchanges.\n",
            "So, if you want to invest in SGBs, the first way is straightforward: wait for the next SGB issue and buy it through your bank.\n",
            "In either way, you can hold them till maturity, sell them prematurely after 5 years, or sell them in the stock market.\n",
            "But it’s crucial to understand the dynamics of buying and selling SGBs on stock exchange so let’s look at them in detail.\n",

            "In hindsight, if we see the final corpus values, it may appear that asset allocation has little to offer.\n",
            "After all, the pure equity portfolio outperforms all the asset-allocation portfolios: 70:30, 80:20 and 60:40.\n",
            "This is obvious as, over the long term, equity tends to outperform debt, so if you add debt to a portfolio, such a portfolio would underperform a pure equity portfolio in the long term.\n",
            "So, it may seem that by simply staying invested in equity, one would do well.\n",
            "However, the reality is somewhat complicated.\n",
            "When you are building wealth through equity, you also have to go through its ups and downs, which can be really sharp at times.\n",
            "We all remember the recent market crash in March 2020, when the Nifty fell from 12,000 levels to about 8,000 levels in a matter of a few days.\n",
            "Such sharp falls can be unnerving for many investors. It’s not easy to see your portfolio crash by a third in just a few days.\n",
            "Remember the first example we discussed. The pure equity portfolio went down from Rs 60 lakh to Rs 40 lakh. It’s not easy to bear a loss of Rs 20 lakh within a few months.\n",
            "And that’s what gives asset allocation its importance.\n",
            "Asset allocation can smoothen your wealth-creation journey. By allocating a certain percentage to debt, you can add a cushion to your portfolio.\n",
            "And as we saw, you don’t have to give up significantly on the returns. Even a 60:40 portfolio is capable of getting you to your goals, of course, with much less volatility.\n",
            "Another advantage of asset allocation and rebalancing is that they automatically take care of the dilemma of when to invest more in equity and when to book profits.\n",
            "For instance, if you want a 70:30 asset allocation towards equity and debt and the market goes up in such a way that you have a 75:25 asset allocation, you can sell some equity and buy debt. This will take care of profit booking in overheated markets.\n",
            "Similarly, if this allocation becomes 65:35 during a bear run, you can shift some corpus from debt to equity. This will ensure that you buy equity when it’s cheap.\n",
            "So, you may have this question in your mind: Which asset allocation should you opt for?\n",
            "How do you decide whether to opt for 80:20, 70:30, or 60:40?\n",
            "It depends on many factors, including your age, risk profile, and time horizon for the goal.\n",
            "Conclusion\n",
            "To sum up, here are the virtues of asset allocation:\n",
            "It helps contain the downside in your portfolio by providing a cushion. It thus helps reduce portfolio risk.\n",
            "It takes care of the dilemma of when to book profits and when to invest more in equity.\n",

            "That time, I realized that I didn’t have to be outstanding in everything I did.\n",
            "If my core areas are solid, I will do well.\n",
            "But why are we talking about all this?\n",
            "The core fund or core portfolio is the main fund in your portfolio. The majority of your money is parked in this portion so, its performance drives the performance of the overall portfolio.\n",
            "A core fund need not be a single fund. It can even be a couple of funds.\n",
            "But why do you need that? Can’t you have a few funds of various types, say, flexi-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, sectoral, thematic, etc., and just divide your money across them?\n",
            "While there is no single way of managing or building a portfolio, the core-satellite approach is among the most popular philosophies in the investment world.\n",
            "In this approach, you have a couple of core funds, which command a large part of your portfolio, and then a couple of satellite funds.\n",
            "The core funds take care of the returns and the stability, and the satellite funds help boost the overall returns or help diversify better.\n",
            "So today, we will examine how you can create your core portfolio and which fund category you can pick. Broadly we will be covering three attributes.\n",
            "Why does a core fund matter for a good portfolio?\n",
            "What are the attributes of a core fund, and what categories can qualify as core funds?\n",
            "Among the categories that qualify, which is the best option?\n",
            "Why does a core fund matter for a good portfolio?\n",
            "Having a core fund or funds has many advantages.\n",
            "A core fund takes care of both the stability and returns of your overall portfolio. The satellite funds can then help boost returns or diversify better.\n",
            "It keeps you focused. You know exactly where to invest across market phases. If you don’t have a core fund, it’s easier to get lost\n",
            "It helps keep things simple. If you can’t spend much time tracking and tracing your portfolio, investing just in the core funds can help you achieve your goals.\n",
            "If you are an adventurous investor, it provides you the flexibility to experiment with your satellite portfolio. With the core of your portfolio being taken care of, even if some of your satellite funds don’t deliver as expected, you would still be largely fine.\n",
            "So, overall, having core funds in your portfolio can ease portfolio management and help you achieve your goals more efficiently.\n",
            "But which funds qualify as core funds? Let’s see.\n",
            "But before we begin, a quick thing, just like getting your funds right, is important, so is having the right term and health insurance. These make sure your dreams and wealth are protected from life’s uncertainties. And that’s why on ET Money, we have hand-picked term and health plans from top insurance companies.

            "Now, let’s continue.\n",
            "What categories can qualify as core funds?\n",
            "Okay, the first question to find the answer to is which category of funds should qualify as core funds. Should it be from equity, or debt or a hybrid category?\n",
            "Now, it’s well known that equity has the best return potential, and if you are in the accumulation phase, it has a crucial role in your portfolio.\n",
            "So, we decided to consider the equity fund category.\n",
            "This is not to say that debt funds or hybrid funds can’t be core funds. A debt fund can be a core fund in a retiree’s portfolio.\n",
            "And if you are looking for automatic asset allocation, even a hybrid fund can be a core fund.\n",
            "However, we will limit our discussion to equity funds as they are the natural choice in the accumulation phase.\n",
            "But, there are 11 equity fund categories, so which should qualify as core funds?\n",
            "In our view, a core fund should have two attributes:\n",
            "It should be able to generate good returns as well as provide stability to your portfolio.\n",
            "It should have minimal restrictions as to how it can invest.\n",
            "By good returns, we mean your returns must be similar to a broader index like NIFTY 50 or better than that.\n",
            "By stability, we mean limited volatility or ups and downs in your portfolio.\n",
            "But why should a core fund have greater freedom to invest, which is our second requisite?\n",
            "Because skewed mandates can increase portfolio risk and limit the benefits of diversification.\n",
            "If the fund must pick stocks of a certain kind only, it will do well only when stocks of that kind do well.\n",
            "For instance, a sectoral fund will do well only when the stocks of that particular sector do well.\n",
            "If they don’t, and that too for an extended period, your returns could suffer. Worse, if those stocks perform poorly, the fund will also do poorly, thanks to its concentration in such stocks.\n",
            "This is not something we would like to see in a core fund.\n",
            "Hence, we chose to pick only those fund categories with considerable freedom to invest anywhere.\n",
            "When it comes to stability, large-cap stocks tend to be the most stable. So, we decided to pick only those categories that have a large-cap allocation of at least 50%.\n",
            "Also, we decided to exclude those categories that are mandated to invest only in a specific type of stock. Such categories have limited freedom to invest.\n",
            "Now, let’s look at the various equity fund categories and find out which ones qualify.\n",

            "Let’s now compare these 5 categories across various risk and return metrics and try to see which is the best.\n",
            "Which is the best core fund category?\n",
            "To measure returns, let’s use a parameter called rolling returns. Rolling returns measure performance across all specified time durations and hence indicate consistency of performance.\n",
            "Since SEBI’s reclassification exercise happened only in 2017, after which many funds changed their mandates and the funds within a category became comparable, let’s take 3-year rolling returns between January 2018 and July 2023.\n",
            "This means all 3-year periods between these dates.\n",
            "Here’s how the 5 categories compare in terms of 3-year average rolling returns. We have also included the Nifty 50 index for comparison purposes.\n",
            "Focused funds are at the top, followed by large & mid-cap funds, flexi-cap funds and ELSS.\n",
            "Large-cap funds are the worst performers. They have done even worse than the Nifty 50 index.\n",
            "Okay, because we are talking about returns, it would be worthwhile to see which category has delivered the highest 3-year rolling returns.\n",
            "Here, large & mid-cap funds appear at the top. ELSS funds secure the next spot. Focused funds, which had appeared at the top earlier, are in the second-last spot.\n",
            "The Nifty 50 TRI is ahead of three categories.\n",
            "So, this was the returns picture of the 5 core fund categories.\n",
            "What about the volatility of these returns? To measure that, we use a parameter called the standard deviation. The higher the standard deviation, the higher the volatility.\n",
            "We looked at the standard deviation of 3-year rolling returns. As you can see, focused funds have exhibited the lowest volatility, with their standard deviation being the same as the Nifty 50.\n",
            "Next come large-cap funds, followed by flexi-cap funds. Large & mid-cap and ELSS funds have proved to be the most volatile.\n",
            "Now, another parameter that we can use to check downside protection is the minimum 3-year rolling returns.\n",
            "Focused funds have done a decent job here, too. Large & mid-cap funds and flexi-cap funds come next.\n",
            "Large-cap funds and the Nifty 50 index have fared poorly across this metric. So have ELSS funds.\n",
            "What does this data tell us?\n",
            "Well, If we see both the average returns and the volatility, focused funds clearly stand out.\n",
            "These funds have delivered higher returns at lower volatility.\n",
            "This is quite interesting as focused funds are likely riskier, given that these funds are mandated to invest in no more than 30 stocks. However, in reality, as of now, this doesn’t seem to be the case.\n",
            "Large-cap funds have failed to outperform the Nifty 50 index both in terms of average returns and volatility.\n",
            "Flexi-cap funds lie right in the middle, both in terms of returns and risk.\n",
            "Given their higher mid-cap exposure, large & mid-cap funds exhibit a high risk-high return profile.\n",
            "ELSS funds have exhibited higher volatility for comparatively lower average returns.\n",
            "Which category should you pick, then? Let’s find out.\n",
            "Picking the Right Core Fund\n",
            "Well, this is the risk and return picture of the various core funds. Surely, you can use it to pick the right funds.\n",
            "However, if you are building a portfolio, you will need to move beyond returns and focus on the broader picture.\n",
            "Let’s see each of the core fund categories and assess for whom they are suitable.\n",
            "1. Let’s start with large-cap funds\n",
            "Large-cap funds have a low return-low risk profile. They are suitable for someone who doesn’t want high volatility with their core funds.\n",
            "However, given that most active large-cap funds are finding it difficult to beat the Nifty 50 index, it would be better to go with an index fund rather than an active large-cap fund.\n",
            "Index funds have another advantage: they take away the burden of picking the right type of fund.\n",
            "When you pick index funds, you know you will get market-like returns. If the market does well, so will you. If it doesn’t, you wouldn’t either.\n",
            "So, in a way, they relieve you from the anxiety of going wrong with your fund pick.\n",
            "2. Next come Large & Mid-Cap Funds\n",
            "Large & mid-cap funds are the aggressive choice for core funds, given their high mid-cap allocation. You can opt for them when returns are your primary focus.\n",
            "However, if you have a separate allocation to mid-cap and small-cap funds in your satellite portfolio, you can do without them.\n",
            "Large & mid-cap funds in the core portfolio and mid-cap and small-cap funds in the satellite portfolio can increase a portfolio’s overall volatility as mid and small-caps tend to be more volatile.\n",
            "3. Let’s now talk about flexi-cap funds\n",
            "Flexi-cap funds are classic go-anywhere funds. These funds have exhibited moderate risk and reward and, hence can be a good complement to most portfolios.\n",
            "If you are not sure which fund you should pick as your core fund, you can simply pick a flexi-cap fund. Or if you think that your fund manager must have complete freedom in picking stocks, flexi-cap funds are the right choice.\n",
            "However, if returns are your primary consideration, you have better options than flexi-cap funds\n",
            "4. Next comes ELSS or tax-saving funds\n",
            "These funds can act as a core fund for anyone who is looking to save tax and build wealth.\n",
            "However, if you don’t have tax-saving as a requirement or you have opted for the new tax regime, these funds could be of limited use.\n",
            "That said, their 3-year lock-in could be beneficial for investors who tend to sell out prematurely and find it difficult to stay put.\n",
            "5. Last but not least: focused funds\n",
            "Focused funds have emerged to be the best among all core funds. They have managed to deliver good returns while containing volatility.\n",
            "As such, they are suitable for any portfolio. However, if the concentration in these funds can make you uncomfortable, you can look to their more diversified flexi-cap peers.\n",
            "So, these are the broad guidelines that you can use to pick funds for your core portfolio.\n",

            "1. What happens to PPF account after maturity?\n",
            "The tenure of a PPF account is 15 years.\n",
            "To be precise, it’s actually more than that because the period is calculated from the end of the financial year in which the deposit is made.\n",
            "So, if you make your first deposit in August 2023, the tenure will be calculated from the end of the financial year in March 2024. Consequently, your 15 years tenure will be completed on April 1, 2039, and not August 2038.\n",
            "But what happens at the end of it?\n",
            "Well, you have three options:\n",
            "The first is pretty straightforward. You withdraw the entire money and close the account.\n",
            "The second option is that you can continue your PPF account without contributing to it so that whatever investments you have made continue to grow.\n",
            "And then there’s a third option. In this, you continue the PPF account beyond 15 years and keep investing like you have been doing.\n",
            "In the second and the third option, the account can be extended in blocks of 5 years for any number of times.\n",
            "Let’s understand these options one by one.\n",
            "This is a simple process.\n",
            "You just need to fill up and submit the account closure form at your bank or at the post office where you have your PPF account.\n",
            "You can apply for the account closure and withdrawal of the corpus once your PPF account matures after 15 years.\n",
            "Now, who should go for this option?\n",
            "If you need the money after your PPF account matures, you can withdraw it and close the account. Or if you have a goal due for which you had been saving in the PPF, you can withdraw the amount.\n",
            "Now, let’s talk about the scenario wherein you don’t want to withdraw the money. For example, you may have started the PPF when you were 30 years old. It will mature by the time you are 46. At that time, most people are at the peak of their careers. So, you may want the money 10 or 15 years later, close to your retirement.\n",
            "If you want to extend your PPF, there are two options, as we mentioned earlier:\n",
            "First, you don’t invest fresh money.\n",
            "Second, you continue your contributions.\n",
            "Let’s understand these two options in detail as each of these have some conditions that you need to fulfil. The conditions are simple. But you must know them so that you can accordingly plan your finances.\n",
            "Regulations allow you to extend the PPF account in blocks of 5 years only. You can extend it as many times as you want by filling up the required forms.\n",
            "When you choose to extend ‘without contribution’, you will continue to earn interest during these 5 years and you don’t have to make any additional contributions.\n",
            "So what are the conditions in this case?\n",
            "Once you decide to extend without contribution, you will need to stick to it. You cannot suddenly decide to contribute to your PPF.\n",
            "If you do make any contributions, they will be treated as ‘irregular’ and will be refunded. You won’t get any tax benefits for such contributions.\n",
            "You can withdraw any amount. But you can do this only once in a financial year.\n",
            "So, if you have Rs 50 lakh in your PPF account, you can withdraw Rs 1,000 or Rs 20 lakh or any other amount; the choice is entirely yours.\n",
            "When should you opt for this option?\n",
            "So, who should go for an extension of the PPF account without contribution?\n",
            "In general, if you don’t need the money and are happy with the PPF as an investment avenue, you can continue.\n",
            "If you had made the PPF investment with a specific goal in mind and the goal is still a few years away, you can choose to stay invested and earn more returns.\n",
            "For instance, you need the PPF money in your retirement, and when the PPF account matures, your retirement is still a few years away. In that case, you can continue to stay invested.\n",
            "If you want to continue contributing to the PPF account after the completion of 15 years, you can opt for this option.\n",
            "Let’s understand the conditions under this option.\n",
            "You will need to opt for this option within one year from the maturity of your PPF account. If you don’t choose this within time, you cannot opt for it at a later date.\n",
            "The second condition is about withdrawals. Remember, when you choose the ‘without contribution’ option, you can make withdrawals only once in a financial year from your PPF account. The same thing is applicable when you extend with contribution. However, you can’t withdraw just any amount you wish.\n",
            "You can withdraw only up to 60% of the amount at the start of the five-year extension period. Let’s understand this with an example.\n",
            "If you had Rs 50 lakh in your PPF when you opted for an extension, you can withdraw up to Rs 30 lakh only. You can either withdraw this in one go or in multiple tranches. But there can be just one withdrawal in a financial year.\n",

            "2. How to make premature withdrawals from your PPF account?\n",
            "Okay, so your PPF account hasn’t completed 15 years, but you are in need of funds. What can you do?\n",
            "Of course, you can withdraw from your PPF account, and as we saw at the beginning of this article, these premature withdrawals are also tax-free. So, you don’t need to worry about the taxes.\n",
            "But these withdrawals are not so straightforward.\n",
            "First, you can make premature withdrawals from your PPF account only after the completion of 5 years.\n",
            "Do note that 5 years means 5 completed financial years starting from the end of the financial year in which you made your first deposit.\n",
            "So, technically, premature withdrawals are possible only from the 7th year of making the investment.\n",
            "For example, if you make your first PPF investment in August 2023, you can make a premature withdrawal only after April 1, 2029.\n",
            "There are some other requisites as well.\n",
            "One, you can make only one premature withdrawal in a financial year.\n",
            "Two, you can withdraw either up to 50% of the account balance at the end of the financial year or 50% of the amount at the end of the fourth financial year preceding the year of application, whichever is lower.\n",
            "For instance, if you make a premature withdrawal request in August 2023 and your PPF account has completed at least 5 financial years, you will get either 50% of the corpus at the end of FY23 or at the end of FY20, whichever is lower.\n",
            "What if you need to make a withdrawal before 5 years? Well, that’s not possible. But you sure can opt for a loan against your PPF balance.\n",
            "Let’s now talk about the premature closure of your PPF account.\n",
            "3. How to close your PPF account before 15 years?\n",
            "We know that the maturity of a PPF account is 15 years. But what if you want to close it before that? Is it even possible?\n",
            "Yes, it is possible, but there are multiple conditions.\n",
            "First, you can close a PPF account only after it has completed 5 financial years.\n",
            "Second, it can be closed only for certain specified reasons. These include\n",
            "Treatment of life-threatening disease of the account holder, their spouse or dependent children or parents\n",
            "Higher education of the account holder or dependent children\n",
            "A change in residency status of the account holder\n",
            "For each of these cases, appropriate documents have to be provided. For example, if you are closing the PPF account due to a change in residency status, a copy of your passport, visa, and income-tax return is needed.\n",
            "Do note that when you prematurely close your account, the interest on your account is recalculated at a rate lower by 1%. This is applicable since the date of account opening or extension, as applicable.\n",
            "So, if you have been getting, say, 8% interest on the PPF all through the tenure, your interest will be recalculated at 7%.\n",
            "This 1% can add up to a lot in the long run.\n",
            "For instance, if you ran your PPF account for 10 years, invested Rs 1.5 lakh in it on April 1 each year, and earned 8% per annum, your corpus will be Rs 23.46 lakh\n",
            "Now, if you decide to close your account prematurely, the entire calculation will be done at 7%. So, your corpus will get reduced to Rs 22.17 lakh\n",
            "So, you will get around 1.29 lakh less.\n",
            "Now, the PPF account is also prematurely closed in case of the death of the account holder The proceeds are paid to the legal heir. However, the heir cannot continue running the account.\n",
            "This brings us to the last section in this article: when is a PPF account discontinued? Let’s take a look.\n",
            "4. What to do if your PPF account has been discontinued?\n",
            "To keep your PPF account active, you must deposit at least Rs 500 in it in a financial year.\n",
            "If you fail to do that, your account will be discontinued or deactivated.\n",
            "To revive a deactivated account, you will need to pay Rs 50 + Rs 500 for each of the financial years during which the account has remained deactivated.\n",
            "As you would recall, this Rs 500 is the minimum contribution amount for the PPF.\n",
            "For instance, if your account has stayed deactivated for 2 financial years, you will need to pay Rs 1,100 – Rs 100 as the penalty and Rs 1,000 as the minimum contribution.\n",
            "If an account has been discontinued, you cannot make premature withdrawals from it. Neither can you take a loan on such an account.\n",
            "You cannot even open a new PPF account until you properly close a deactivated account.\n",
            "However, a discontinued PPF account continues to earn interest.\n",
            "With this, we have come to the end of this article.\n",
            "We hope you found the information helpful and it will help you better manage your PPF.\n",

            "And so most people invest in mid and small-cap funds looking at past returns, only to realize during choppy markets that they can’t tolerate the wild swings in investments they have in these funds and exit.\n",

            "So, is there a better way to take exposure to mid and small-caps?\n",
            "That’s exactly what we will cover in this article.\n",
            "Here, we will analyze whether multi-cap funds are a ‘better’ way to take exposure to mid and small-caps.\n",
            "Can multi-cap funds give you high returns like mid and small-caps with lesser volatility?\n",
            "And this analysis is quite unique as we created our proxy multi-cap fund since there isn’t enough data on the performance of multi cap funds.\n",
            "Now you could be wondering why we are looking at multi-cap funds as a substitute for mid and small-cap funds.\n",
            "There is a good reason. Let’s first understand that.\n",
            "Substitutes For Mid-cap And Small-Cap Funds\n",
            "There are some mutual fund categories where the fund managers have complete liberty to invest anywhere they wish.\n",
            "Depending on the market conditions, they can invest in large-cap, mid-cap, or small-cap stocks. And so they have the flexibility to invest a large chunk of your money in mid or small-caps if they wish.\n",
            "Now, there are seven such categories: flexi-cap, multi-cap, large and mid-caps, ELSS, value/contra, focused and thematic/sector funds.\n",
            "However, of these, only three don’t have restrictions in terms of the lock-in, number of stocks, investment philosophy, and investment space.\n",
            "These are flexi-cap funds, large & mid-cap funds, and multi-cap funds. We have now zeroed in on three categories. Let’s talk about them further.\n",
            "Flexi-cap funds can invest in companies of any size in any proportion.\n",
            "Multi-cap funds must compulsorily invest at least 25% each in large, mid, and small caps.\n",
            "And lastly, Large & mid-cap funds must invest at least 35% each in large and mid-caps. They are not mandated to invest in small caps, but they have room to do so.\n",
            "So, in theory, these three diversified categories can get you exposure to mid and small-caps. They don’t have any other restrictions.\n",
            "But things are not as simple as they seem.\n",
            "The chart above shows the flexi cap category’s average allocation to different market caps at the end of each quarter since 2020. As you can see, their large-cap exposure has averaged around 66% over the last 3 years.\n",
            "So by the looks of it, they don’t invest a big part of their corpus in mid-and small-cap stocks. And therefore might not be the best category if you are looking for decent mid- and small-cap exposure.\n",
            "Let’s now talk about large & mid-cap funds.\n",
            "Thanks to their mandate, these schemes have a sizable allocation to mid-caps, but their exposure to small caps is quite low. It has averaged just 7.42% over the last 3 years.\n",
            "So, This leaves us with only multi-cap funds. With their mandated exposure of at least 25% in all market caps, these funds will always have at least 50% in mid and small caps.\n",
            "This is the reason why they could be a good proxy to invest in mid-and small-cap stocks. That’s what it feels, at least in theory.\n",
            "One more reason why we decided to analyze the multi-cap category as a good proxy for investing in mid- and small-cap funds is their recent returns.\n",
            "In the past six months, there has been a rally in mid-and small-cap stocks. This is reflected in the returns of not only mid-cap and small-cap funds but also in multi-cap funds.\n",
            "Here are some numbers. In the past three months, the average returns of multi-cap funds have been about 14%. Mid-cap and small-cap funds have given about 16% and 17%, respectively.\n",

            "So, there is a trend, so we decided to look deeper into it. But before we go any further, it’s essential to know a few things about these funds.\n",
            "We don’t obviously expect multi-cap funds to beat mid-cap and small-cap funds. Multi-caps have a good allocation to large-cap stocks. So, they may or may not do better than mid-cap and small-cap funds.\n",
            "With over 50% in mid-caps and small-caps, we want to see if multi-cap funds can participate in their rally, giving investors higher returns. And achieve better returns with lower volatility than mid-cap and small-cap funds.\n",
            "But first, let’s take a quick look at the background of multi-cap funds.\n",
            "Background of multi-cap funds\n",
            "The history of multi-cap funds is slightly confusing.\n",
            "These funds have always been there if we just go by the name ‘multi-cap’. The category has been there for a while, and they were allowed to invest in companies of all sizes and any proportion.\n",
            "However, most multi-cap funds were large-cap-heavy and had minimal mid and small caps exposure. They weren’t ‘multi-cap’ in essence.\n",
            "So, in September 2020, SEBI came out with a rule that multi-cap funds should be true to label and therefore must have at least 25% each in large, mid, and small caps.\n",
            "But this move created a problem for the industry. Many multi-cap funds at that time had big allocation to large caps, and shifting that to mid and small-caps to comply with the revised multi-cap mandate would have caused quite a lot of issues.\n",
            "So, SEBI introduced the flexi-cap category. And most AMCs reclassified their multi-cap funds as flexi caps and then launched new multi-cap funds\n",
            "In short, what were multi-caps earlier are now known as flexi caps in most cases. The multi-cap category currently has 21 funds.\n",
            "Now, let’s get back to analyzing these funds.\n",
            "Given that this category is new, we had to develop a special method to assess multi-caps.\n",
            "Let’s understand what it is and how we did it.\n",
            "Multi Cap Category Simulation\n",
            "Since there is limited data on multi-caps, any concrete analysis was not possible.\n",
            "So, we decided to simulate the performance of a multi-cap fund.\n",
            "We created our multi-cap fund and then studied the performance of this multi-cap fund for the long term. This will give us a fair idea of what to expect from multi-cap schemes.\n",
            "This fund that we created is similar to the existing multi-cap funds. Let me explain how we did it.\n",
            "First, we used three indices to create this multi-cap fund. The 3 indices are – Nifty 100 TRI, Nifty Midcap 150 TRI and Nifty Smallcap 250 TRI.\n",
            "Because equity funds also have a cash component, we took SBI Liquid Fund as the proxy. SBI Liquid is the largest liquid fund as of June 2023. It is also one of the oldest in the category.\n",
            "Next, we had to decide in what proportion these indices should be in our multi-cap fund.\n",
            "To find that, we found out the average market-cap allocation of multi-cap funds over the last 2 years.\n",
            "On average, multi-cap funds have invested around 42% in large caps, 26% and 27% in mid and small caps, respectively. They have had about 6% cash.\n",
            "Large caps: 41.66%\n",
            "Mid caps: 26.06%\n",
            "Small caps: 26.68%\n",
            "Others/cash: 6.46%\n",
            "So, we decided to use the same asset allocation for our proxy multi-cap fund.\n",
            "Nifty 100 TRI: 42%\n",
            "Nifty Midcap 150 TRI: 26%\n",
            "Nifty Smallcap 250 TRI: 26%\n",
            "SBI Liquid Fund: 6%\n",
            "To maintain this allocation, the proxy multi-cap fund was rebalanced on January 1 every year.\n",
            "And then, we studied the performance of this proxy multi-cap fund against the Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Smallcap 250 indices between June 2013 and June 2023.\n",
            "What did we find? Let’s see.\n",
            "Comparing Returns\n",
            "We will start by comparing the returns of our proxy multi-cap fund with those of the Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Smallcap 250 indices.\n",
            "Let’s start with the trailing returns. See the chart on your screen.\n",
            "While the proxy multi-cap fund didn’t come out on top every time, it was able to outperform the small-cap index across five- and seven-year periods.\n",
            "The mid-cap index has had the best run based on this metric. It appeared at the top in 3 of the 4 periods.\n",
            "Another useful parameter for measuring returns is rolling returns, as you measure performance across time for all possible combinations.\n",
            "So, in the case of 5-year rolling returns, it would be across any five-year period over a specified time band.\n",
            "The chart below shows the average, maximum, and minimum returns of the mid-cap index, the small-cap index, and the proxy multi-cap portfolio.\n",
            "As you can see, while our multi-cap portfolio did better than the small-cap index in terms of average 5-year rolling returns and minimum 5-year rolling returns, the mid-cap index has again stolen the show.\n",
            "So, the proxy multi-cap fund is quite a competition for the small-cap index. However, as compared to the mid-cap index, its performance is wanting.\n",
            "Let’s now talk about the volatility of the multi-cap portfolio vis-a-vis the mid-cap and the small-cap indices.\n",
            "Comparing Volatility\n",
            "Discussion of returns without looking at volatility is only half the picture.\n",
            "In an ideal world, you want high returns with no volatility or absolute certainty.\n",
            "Sadly that doesn’t happen. Often, the higher the return potential, the more volatility is involved.\n",
            "We checked the volatility of the five-year rolling returns by looking at the standard deviation. The higher the standard deviation, the higher the volatility.\n",
            "Downside Protection\n",
            "So, we wanted to check here if the multi-cap portfolio offers better downside protection than mid-cap and small-cap indices.\n",
            "To do so, we first defined what a downside is. For that, we considered those quarterly periods over the last 10 years when the Nifty 50 gave negative returns.\n",
            "We then checked the returns of the proxy multi-cap portfolio, the mid-cap index, and the small-cap index across all such quarters.\n",

            "For example, we rebalanced the portfolio only once a year. In real life, a fund manager has no such obligation. Also, we took the average asset allocation to determine index weights in the proxy multi-cap portfolio.\n",
            "In real life, funds can have different asset allocations, and a fund’s asset allocation can change across the spectrum.\n",

            "If you are someone who doesn’t like too many ups and downs in your portfolio, you can very well remain with diversified equity funds.\n",
            "To better understand this risk-return equation, let’s look at the 5-year rolling returns from 2013 of Nifty 50, Nifty 500, Nifty Mid cap 150, and Nifty Small cap 250\n",
            "Now, the mid-cap index has delivered the best performance. Nifty 50 and Nifty 500 have done a decent job, while the small-cap index has failed to impress.\n",
            "But one should not see returns alone. Returns should be seen in conjunction with the ensuing volatility.\n",
            "If you had to tolerate more ups and downs to get one to two percentage points extra, perhaps the extra returns are not as appealing.\n",
            "So how volatile are all the indices we mentioned above? For this, we looked at their standard deviation. The higher the standard deviation, the more volatility.\n",
            "As you might have guessed, mid- and small caps are quite volatile. Notably, the small-cap index has proved to be the most volatile and hasn’t delivered either.\n",
            "Hence, invest in the mid-and small-cap categories, especially the small-cap ones, only after much thought. A large allocation to mid- and small-cap funds in your portfolio can make it swing wildly with market winds.\n",
            "If you do decide to invest in them, avoid not putting more than 30% of the worth of your portfolio in them.\n",
            "Let’s now talk about the next mistake: not reviewing your portfolio.\n",
            "4. Not reviewing your portfolio\n",
            "Yet another common mistake that investors make is that they don’t review their portfolio periodically.\n",
            "This is essential. It helps you to cut down on risks and problems. And this can help you boost your returns.\n",
            "Let me give you one example from my portfolio. In 2014, I started investing in a tax saving fund. (Aditya Birla SL ELSS Tax Relief 96) It was doing quite well at that time. For three years, the fund outperformed NIFTY 50 and NIFTY 500.\n",
            "But from 2018 onwards, it started slipping. It has underperformed the benchmark since then. I waited for four years of continuous underperformance to stop my SIPs. So, finally, I stopped investing in it in 2022. I will be able to withdraw from it entirely by 2025. Until then, I am stuck with it.\n",
            "If I had reviewed my portfolio regularly, I could have stopped my SIPs earlier in 2020 or 2021 after two to three years of underperformance. And I could have possibly exited the fund entirely this year. My portfolio returns would have been slightly better.\n",
            "But portfolio review is not only about looking at underperforming funds. For example, you check for exposure to different asset classes when reviewing your portfolio. You see, if you have too many funds in the same category. You can even go much deeper to see if your funds complement each other and whether the fund strategy has changed over the years.\n",
            "Over the years, I have realized that there’s nothing as a perfect or a hopeless portfolio. There are only optimized and unoptimized portfolios. And the difference between the two could be significant.\n",
            "Let’s now see how not reviewing your portfolio can compromise the quality of your portfolio.\n",
            "We all know that the top funds keep changing every few years. A fund giving you high returns for the past three-four years can suddenly start underperforming. And it can continue to do so for years to come.\n",
            "See the chart on your screen.\n",
            "This chart could be a bit technical. It shows the percent of funds across categories that have fallen from the top quartile, or the top 25% in terms of returns, over the last two years.\n",
            "To put it simply, it shows how the top-performing funds change every two years. For example, in the large-cap category, most top funds change every two years. On the other hand, in the ELSS category, the top-performing funds don’t change as often in two years.\n",
            "So, even if you have picked good funds, you should regularly monitor your portfolio.\n",
            "Of course, a slight deterioration in the fund’s performance over the short term is no cause for concern. However, if a fund continues to underperform for two years or more, you should consider exiting it.\n",
            "You can find tools available on ET Money to help you with this. The Fund Report Card can help to understand whether the fund is worth investing. Then there is a Portfolio Health Check which gives a thorough portfolio analysis, which can be a good starting point.\n",
            "Let’s now move to the next point: not starting with a financial plan.\n",
            "5. Not starting with a financial plan\n",
            "Many of us start investing right away without first giving a thought to what we want to achieve with our investments.\n",
            "That is to say, we don’t have a financial plan in place.\n",
            "Just think of this: what do you do when you are going on a vacation?\n",
            "You first decide on a destination and then the budget. Following this, you book tickets and stay and look for places of interest that you would go to.\n",
            "I don’t think any of us step out of the house without knowing the destination. We don’t pack our bags, then go to the airport and then start looking for tickets to some place where we can spend time holidaying.\n",
            "Same is with financial planning.\n",
            "Without a financial plan, investing is like shooting arrows in the dark.\n",
            "Even if you do your SIPs diligently and have a long-term focus, you won’t know how much to save for which goal without a financial plan.\n",
            "You won’t know whether your SIP amount is enough, if you need to increase it, and by how much.\n",
            "Another issue is that you won’t have an exit plan, which can delay your goals. That’s because markets don’t know which year you need the money for the purpose you are saving. They will crash at their whim.\n",
            "Let me explain with an example. Suppose you started investing in 2010 in equities, and then in November 2019, you decided to buy a house. By the time you finalized a house, it was March. But markets crashed due to COVID-19. And since your entire money was in equity, a large chunk of your gains would have been wiped away, forcing you to delay buying a house till your investments recover.\n",
            "So, to avoid such negative surprises at a time when you can afford them the least, it’s better to have a financial plan in place.\n",
            "Financial planning has other hidden benefits:\n",
            "It provides a sense of direction and purpose.\n",
            "It keeps you on track.\n",
            "It provides measurable steps. And what gets measured gets done.\n",
            "It helps you stay focused and motivated.\n",
            "Interestingly, a financial plan doesn’t start with investing.\n",
            "It starts with building a sufficient emergency fund, which should be equal to 6 to 12 months of your expenses.\n",

There are three advantages of investing in SGBs – You get the appreciation in the underlying gold prices, there is 2.5% interest payout every year, and you don’t have to pay any tax on gains you make when SGBs mature.\\nBut there’s a way to get SGBs at a discounted price.\\nAfter the issue is over, RBI lists Sovereign Gold Bonds on stock exchanges. Now, many times, these old issues trade at a discount. If you are lucky, you can get a discount of 1% to 6%.\\nBut before you rush to buy these old gold bonds, there are a few things that you need to understand.\\nAnd that’s what we will talk about today.\\nThis article is divided into 3 sections.\\nA quick introduction to SGBs\\nWe will discuss buying and selling SGBs on stock exchanges in detail. And its pros and cons.\\nWe will compare older and new issues to help you pick the right one.\\nWhat Are Sovereign Gold Bonds?\\nSovereign gold bonds were introduced by the government in 2015.\\nAlthough the returns on these bonds are pegged to gold prices, no actual gold is backing them.\\nYes, you read it right. There is no underlying gold in the case of sovereign gold bonds.\\nIt’s a bond that is pegged to gold prices and has a sovereign guarantee.\\nSo, at maturity, the redemption happens as per the prevailing gold prices.\\nFor example, you invest today at Rs 5,900 per gram.\\nAfter eight years, the bond matures. At that time, the gold price is Rs 12,000 per gram.\\nThe government will pay you around Rs 12,000 for one unit of SGB on maturity (The actual maturity price is a simple average of gold price for the previous three business days).\\nFrom time to time, the government comes up with SGB issues, and one can invest in SGBs online or offline during such occasions through banks, designated post offices, and the Stock Holding Corporation of India.\\nSGBs have an eight-year tenure. But it’s not that you have to hold onto your SGBs for 8 years. You can redeem them after five years as well.\\nThe RBI announces the early redemption windows from time to time.\\nFurther, if a user buys SGB from the bank, they can get it dematerialized and sell it on the secondary market if they want to sell it prematurely.\\nNow as you can sell SGBs on stock exchanges, similarly you can even invest in them through exchanges.\\nSo, if you want to invest in SGBs, the first way is straightforward: wait for the next SGB issue and buy it through your bank.\\nIn either way, you can hold them till maturity, sell them prematurely after 5 years, or sell them in the stock market.\\nBut it’s crucial to understand the dynamics of buying and selling SGBs on stock exchange so let’s look at them in detail.\\nThe key features of SGBs are summarised in the table below.\\n\\n| Key features of sovereign gold bonds   | Key features of sovereign gold bonds          |\\n|:---------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|\\n| Minimum investment                     | 1 unit = 1 gm                                 |\\n| Maximum investment                     | 4 kg                                          |\\n| Purity                                 | 24 kt or 999 (highest grade)                  |\\n| Returns                                | As per gold prices                            |\\n| Interest                               | 2.5% p.a.                                     |\\n| Tenure                                 | 8 years but exit after five years is possible |\\nBuying and Selling SGBs on the stock exchange\\nSGB issues are listed on stock exchanges, so if you have a demat and a trading account, you can buy them.\\nFor example, currently 64 SGB issues are listed on the stock exchange\\n\\n| Symbol     |   Price (Rs) | Symbol     |   Price (Rs) | Symbol     |   Price (Rs) | Symbol     |   Price (Rs) |\\n|:-----------|-------------:|:-----------|-------------:|:-----------|-------------:|:-----------|-------------:|\\n| SGBOCT25IV |      5850    | SGBMAR25   |      5909.5  | SGBAUG28V  |      5893.16 | SGBDEC25XI |      5880    |\\n| SGBFEB24   |      5862.01 | SGBJUL28IV |      5860.1  | SGBNOV258  |      5915    | SGBOCT25V  |      5997    |\\n| SGBAUG24   |      5899.87 | SGBMAY28   |      5864.03 | SGBJUL27   |      5933    | SGBNOV25VI |      5997    |\\n| SGBDC27VII |      5885    | SGBJUN28   |      5860.76 | SGBDEC25   |      5847    | SGBDEC26   |      5979.99 |\\n| SGBOC28VII |      5873.37 | SGBNV29VII |      5870.4  | SGBFEB27   |      5869.89 | SGBOCT26   |      5900    |\\n| SGBNOV24   |      5915    | SGBJUN30   |      5879.25 | SGBNOV26   |      5990    | SGBOCT27   |      5900    |\\n| SGBD29VIII |      5870    | SGBSEP28VI |      5906.05 | SGBJAN26   |      5959    | SGBJAN27   |      5865    |\\n| SGBJAN30IX |      5846.77 | SGBJ28VIII |      5899    | SGBFEB28IX |      5899.99 | SGBJUN31I  |      5957.15 |\\n| SGBSEP24   |      5911    | SGBFEB29XI |      5884    | SGBNOV25IX |      5989    | SGBNOV23   |      5931    |\\n| SGBMAY26   |      5900    | SGBOCT25   |      5900    | SGBJAN29X  |      5869.21 | SGBMAR24   |      5908    |\\n| SGBOCT27VI |      5860.3  | SGBAUG30   |      5914.81 | SGBSEP27   |      5950    | SGBJAN29IX |      5879.05 |\\n| SGBAUG27   |      5924    | SGBAPR28I  |      5896.66 | SGBMAY25   |      5895    | SGBJUL29IV |      5880.69 |\\n| SGBDE30III |      5889.98 | SGBMAR28X  |      5918.46 | SGBDEC2513 |      5984    | SGBMAR30X  |      5922.98 |\\n| SGBMAR31IV |      5943.02 | SGBSEP29VI |      5912.81 | SGBNOV25   |      5875    | SGBN28VIII |      5888.7  |\\n| SGBJU29III |      5861.3  | SGBJUN29II |      5868.33 | SGBJUL25   |      5884.9  | SGBAUG29V  |      5900    |\\n| SGBMAY29I  |      5874.12 | SGBMR29XII |      5898.91 | SGBDEC2512 |      5984    | SGBJUN27   |      5890    |\\nFrom their symbol, you can figure out when that SGB issue is due for maturity. For instance, if the symbol is SGBOCT25IV, it is due to mature in October 2025 and was the fourth SGB series of the year when it was launched.\\nWhat’s interesting is that often, these Issues trade at a discount to the prevailing gold price. So, if you are planning to invest in gold today then you may get it at a discount.\\nFor instance, the spot price of 1 gram of 24 kt gold as per the Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association on 31st August 2023 was Rs 5,948.50.\\nThe discount on SGBs with respect to this price was as high as 1.71%.\\n\\n| With respect to IBJA’s spot gold price of Rs 5948.50 on August 31, 2023   | With respect to IBJA’s spot gold price of Rs 5948.50 on August 31, 2023   | With respect to IBJA’s spot gold price of Rs 5948.50 on August 31, 2023   |\\n|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Symbol                                                                    | Price (Rs)                                                                | Discount (%)                                                              |\\n| SGBJAN30IX                                                                | 5846.77                                                                   | 1.71                                                                      |\\n| SGBDEC25                                                                  | 5847.00                                                                   | 1.71                                                                      |\\n| SGBOCT25IV                                                                | 5850.00                                                                   | 1.66                                                                      |\\n| SGBJUL28IV                                                                | 5860.10                                                                   | 1.49                                                                      |\\n| SGBOCT27VI                                                                | 5860.30                                                                   | 1.48                                                                      |\\n| SGBJUN28                                                                  | 5860.76                                                                   | 1.47                                                                      |\\n| SGBJU29III                                                                | 5861.30                                                                   | 1.47                                                                      |\\n| SGBFEB24                                                                  | 5862.01                                                                   | 1.45                                                                      |\\n| SGBMAY28                                                                  | 5864.03                                                                   | 1.42                                                                      |\\nSo, technically speaking, one can buy the SGB cheaper on the stock exchange as compared to the prevailing gold prices.\\nIf the above discounts are not very tempting to you, wait.

Now, that volume is not very large if you consider the size of Indian markets.\\nFurther, there a few SGBs that didn’t trade on the day.\\nJust one unit of SGBNOV26, SGBOCT25 and SGBJUN27 were traded.\\nAnd it’s not that the volumes were thin on this particular day.\\nWe checked the volumes for several months and observed this trend.\\nSo, what does it imply?\\nIf you want to buy SGBs on the secondary market, you must trade those with ample volume.And there is no surety that the SGB which has a high volume on one day will also have high volumes on another day.\\nSo, once you buy them, you may not be able to sell them on exchanges in the future.\\nThe best way to buy is to look at the depth of volume. You can checkk the depth by looking at “bids and offer” section.\\nAnd try to match them to get your order through.\\nWhen you check the offer section, you will see the prices that sellers are asking for.\\nFor instance, if you are trying to buy an SGB at Rs 5,850 and are not able to do so, you can check your broking account or the exchange’s website for the available offers.\\nIf the offer is for Rs 5,900, you can quote that price and get your trade executed.\\nYou will pay Rs 50 more, but at least the trade will be executed.\\nThis is a practical problem with buying and selling SGBs on stock exchanges – The impact cost can be high.\\nThe table below shows which SGBs are trading at discount and have good volumes.\\n\\n| Discount with respect to IBJA’s spot gold price of Rs 5948.50/gram as

happens to it, when you buy them on the exchange?\\nYou are still entitled to the interest when you buy SGBs from the stock exchange.\\nHowever, this interest is calculated on the original issue price. So, if the price at which you buy the SGB from stock market is higher than the issue price then your effective yield may get lower.\\nLet’s look at an example.\\nIf someone bought the SGBMAY26 from the stock exchange on 31 Aug 2023 then the price he would have paid must have been around Rs. 5900.\\nHowever, the issue price for this SGB was Rs 3,064. Now the interest of 2.5% is calculated on the basis of issue price which in this case is Rs. 3064. 2.5% of Rs. 3064 is Rs. 76.6.\\nBut, for someone who bought if for Rs. 5900 the interest earned of Rs. 76.6 converts to an yield of 1.3%.\\n\\n| Interest calculation for SGBMAY26                                                                     |   Interest calculation for SGBMAY26

                               76.6 |\\n| Last traded price (Rs)                                                                                |                              5900   |\\n| Applicable interest rate when buying from secondary market (interest divided by last traded price, %) |                                 1.3 |\\nSo, when you buy the issue through secondary market then the interest rate that they will get might differ.\\nOkay, so what should you do?\\nShould you buy an SGB when a new issue arrives or buy it from the stock exchange?\\nThe answer will depend on – Where you can make better returns and which method suits you.\\nSo, let’s see.\\nWhat’s a Better Way of Investing in SGBs?\\nOkay, so should you invest in SGBs at the time of a new issue or buy them from the secondary market?\\nLet’s first see which is the more lucrative option.\\nThe average discount on the current SGBs is around 1% to the prevailing gold prices.\\nLet’s say the new SGB issue price is the same as the prevailing gold price of Rs 5,948.5.\\nIf you invest in such an SGB and hold it for the next 8 years, you will make about 7.59% returns on your investments, assuming that gold gives 6% returns every year.\\n\\n| Buying an SGB during the issue       |   Buying an SGB during the issue |\\n|:-------------------------------------|---------------------------------:|\\n| Year of issue

also been noticed that the discount in the secondary market can be quite steep at times.\\nFor example, in April 2023, SGBs were trading at a discount of 8-9% from the prevailing gold prices. It is all about the market mood on the day you decide to buy.\\n\\n| With respect to the then gold price of Rs 6,062/gram   | With respect to the then gold price of Rs 6,062/gram   | With respect to

respect to the original return of 7.59%, it’s not a very significant increase.\\nSo, mathematically speaking, the benefits of buying SGBs on the exchange are rather limited.\\nDo note that we have not taken into account the brokerage here, which you may have to pay when you buy SGBs in the secondary market.\\nBrokerage is a cost, and hence it will pull down your returns.\\nPlus, buying and selling SGBs on stock exchanges will entail tax as well. This can wipe off the extra returns you would make by investing in SGBs through the secondary market.\\nAll in all, it’s advisable to see SGBs as a long-term investment option and hold them till maturity.\\nIf you plan to trade in SGBs, you may not end up making any gains.\\nSo, if you have a demat account, you can buy them on the exchange. If you are lucky and get a steep discount, you can earn slightly higher returns.\\nBut keep in mind that buying on the stock exchange involves brokerage as well. So, that will be an additional cost.\\nThose who don’t want to get into the hassles of operating a demat account can subscribe to SGBs at the time of the issue.\\nThe pros and cons of investing in SGBs at the time of a new issue and through the stock market are summarised in the table below.\\n\\n| At the time of a new issue                                                                                            | Through the stock market                                             |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|------:|------:|------:|\\n| Doesn’t require a demat and a trading account                                                                         | Requires a demat and a trading account                               |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| Premature exit is possible only after 5 years                                                                         | Anytime entry and exit                                               |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| Price determined by the RBI based on the prevailing gold rates; a discount of Rs 50 is applicable on online purchases | SGBs are often available at a discount to the prevailing gold prices |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| No additional costs                                                                                                   | Brokerage, demat charges may be applicable                           |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| Lack of clarity on taxation on premature withdrawal                                                                   | Lack of clarity on taxation on secondary-market sale                 |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| For best results, stay invested till maturity                                                                         | For best results, stay invested till maturity                        |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\nWe hope the above helped you evaluate the different waysof investing in SGBs.\\nIf you have not yet started your mutual funds investments, then you can get started with ET Money.

              "  'content': 'Think of choosing between two jobs. The first job offers great pay, but it’s accompanied by stress, uncertainty, and sleepless nights. On the other hand, the second job pays a bit less, but it’s more stable, with predictable working conditions and job security.\\nWhich one will you choose?\\nA portfolio with asset allocation is like the second option. It offers stability. So, you are more likely to stay motivated to invest for the long term. On the contrary, the pure equity path can be unnerving.\\nEven if you think you have an appetite to bear the volatility the question that you should answer is – Is Pure Equity Portfolio Even worth it?\\nAnd that’s exactly what we will cover in this article.\\nSo, we will analyze different portfolios with certain asset allocations and see how these portfolios perform in comparison to a pure equity portfolio.\\nBased on our observations, we will assess the efficacy of asset allocation.\\nThis article is divided into 4 sections:\\nPure equity portfolio vs 70:30 portfolio, i.e., a portfolio with 70% equity and 30% debt\\nPure equity portfolio vs 80:20 portfolio\\nPure equity portfolio vs 60:40 portfolio\\nEvaluating the efficacy of asset allocation, i.e., why asset allocation and its close cousin rebalancing matter\\nSo, let’s begin with comparing a pure equity portfolio with a portfolio that has 70% equity and 30% debt.\\nPure Equity vs 70:30 portfolio\\nOkay, what if you have a pure equity portfolio on one side and a portfolio with 70% equity and 30% debt on the other?\\nFor equity, we have considered the Nifty 50 TRI. For debt, we have taken the I-Sec Sovereign Bond Index.\\nWe assumed monthly SIPs of Rs 20,000 in both these portfolios for the last 15 years and took the actual market scenario between April 2008 and April 2023.\\nThe 70:30 portfolio was rebalanced annually in April. Now this point is important. What this means is that every year in April, we brought back the asset allocation to 70:30 by rebalancing the portfolio.\\nThe table below shows the final investment value for both these portfolios\\n\\n| nan                     | Pure equity portfolio   | 70:30 portfolio   |\\n|:------------------------|:------------------------|:------------------|\\n| Value of equity portion | 96.9 lakh               | 64.97 lakh        |\\n| Value of debt portion   | 0                       | 27.84 lakh        |\\n| Total portfolio value   | 96.9 lakh               | 92.82 lakh        |\\nAs you can see, the pure equity portfolio has turned the total SIPs of Rs 36 lakh into a corpus of about 97 lakhs.\\nOn the other hand, with the 70:30 portfolio one would have made Rs 93 lakh, that’s Rs 4 lakh less.\\nSo does it mean asset allocation has failed as you could have done better by allocating all the money to equity and then doing nothing?\\nWell, when we see just the final values, this kind of an impression is obvious. But the reality is quite different.\\nTo assess the need of asset allocation, it would be worthwhile to see how the two portfolios behaved when markets fell.\\nFor this, we look at drawdowns.\\nA drawdown is a fall in the portfolio value from its previous high. The greater the fall, the greater the drawdown.\\nThe table shows the top 10 drawdowns that happened in the market and how the two portfolios behaved during those periods.\\n\\n| Date      | Drawdown: Pure equity portfolio   | Drawdown: Pure equity portfolio   | Drawdown: 70:30 portfolio   | Drawdown: 70:30 portfolio   | Safety offered by 70:30 Portfolio   |\\n|:----------|:----------------------------------|:----------------------------------|:----------------------------|:----------------------------|:------------------------------------|\\n| nan       | In %                              | In Rs                             | In %                        | In Rs                       | (In Rs)                             |\\n| 02/Apr/20 | -33.16                            | -1979317                          | -21.77                      | -1242479                    | 736838                              |\\n| 02/Jul/22 | -11.16                            | -1085559                          | -8.06                       | -730006                     | 355553                              |\\n| 02/Feb/11 | -9.72                             | -94910                            | -6.47                       | -58961                      | 35949                               |\\n| 02/Mar/16 | -9.52                             | -288049                           | -3.35                       | -96272                      | 191777                              |\\n| 02/Sep/15 | -9.38                             | -283670                           | -5.67                       | -162727                     | 120943                              |\\n| 02/Sep/19 | -9.03                             | -513011                           | -4.64                       | -248980                     | 264031                              |\\n| 02/Jan/12 | -8.11                             | -84162                            | -2.93                       | -30066                      | 54095                               |\\n| 02/Nov/18 | -7.98                             | -416347                           | -4.79                       | -232212                     | 184135                              |\\n| 02/Mar/23 | -6.70                             | -694049                           | -4.30                       | -412757                     | 281292                              |\\n*Drawdown is measured on SIP dates. Drawdown is the difference in portfolio value from the peak portfolio value at earlier SIP dates. The SIP date taken is 2nd of every month.\\nFor instance, after the COVID-19 crash, In April 2020 the pure equity portfolio was down 33.16% from its previous high on January 2, 2020. On the other hand, the 70:30 portfolio fell only by 21.77%.\\nSo on January 2, 2020, the portfolio value stood at close to Rs 60 lakh, but at the close of day on April 2, 2020, it had lost Rs. 20 lakhs, and its value was around Rs. 40 lakh.\\nDuring the same period, the portfolio value of 70:30 portfolio on April 2, 2020, stood close to Rs 44.5 lakh and it fell by about Rs 12.5 lakh from Jan 2020 peak..\\nThus, the 70:30 portfolio suffered a less steep correction.\\nThis trend repeated on the other almost every time markets saw deep correction. A 70:30 portfolio fell much less than the pure equity portfolio. You can see this on your screen if you look at the last column of the table.\\nThe 70:30 portfolio has saved anywhere between Rs 36,000 to as much as Rs 7.37 lakh.\\nTo help you understand better, you can find attached the summary data.\\nOkay, this was the 70:30 portfolio. What will happen if we have an 80:20 portfolio? Will the virtues of asset allocation still be there?\\nLet’s see.\\nPure equity vs. 80:20 portfolio\\nLet’s first see the final value of the corpus for the 80:20 portfolio. This is a slightly more aggressive portfolio than the 70:30 portfolio.\\n\\n| nan                     | Pure equity portfolio   | 80:20 portfolio   |\\n|:------------------------|:------------------------|:------------------|\\n| Value of equity portion | 96.9 lakh               | 75.49 lakh        |\\n| Value of debt portion   | 0                       | 18.87 lakh        |\\n| Total portfolio value   | 96.9 lakh               | 94.37 lakh        |\\nThe conditions are the same as those for the 70:30 portfolio. So, we are checking the portfolio for a Rs 20,000 SIP between April 2008 and 2023.\\nWhile the pure equity portfolio managed to generate about Rs 97 lakh, the 80:20 portfolio yielded over Rs 94 lakh, a difference of about Rs 2.5 lakh.\\nNow, let’s also see the downside protection offered by 80:20 portfolio.\\n\\n| Date      | Drawdown: Pure equity portfolio   | Drawdown: Pure equity portfolio   | Drawdown: 80:20 portfolio   | Drawdown: 80:20 portfolio   | Difference in drawdowns   |\\n|:----------|:----------------------------------|:----------------------------------|:----------------------------|:----------------------------|:--------------------------|\\n| nan       | In %                              | In Rs                             | In %                        | In Rs                       | In Rs                     |\\n| 02/Apr/20 | -33.16                            | -1979317                          | -25.55                      | -1481515                    | 497802                    |\\n| 02/Jul/22 | -11.16                            | -1085559                          | -9.10                       | -848686                     | 236873                    |\\n| 02/Feb/11 | -9.72                             | -94910                            | -7.57                       | -70724                      | 24186                     |\\n| 02/Mar/16 | -9.52                             | -288049                           | -5.26                       | -153461                     | 134588                    |\\n| 02/Sep/15 | -9.38                             | -283670                           | -6.75                       | -197029                     | 86641                     |\\n| 02/Sep/19 | -9.03                             | -513011                           | -6.07                       | -332013                     | 180998                    |\\n| 02/Jan/12 | -8.11                             | -84162                            | -4.62                       | -47668                      | 36493                     |\\n| 02/Nov/18 | -7.98                             | -416347                           | -5.88                       | -292467                     | 123880                    |\\n| 02/Mar/23 | -6.70                             | -694049                           | -5.11                       | -505651                     | 188398                    |\\nWe found that even the portfolio’s 20% debt component goes a long way in containing the downside.\\nLet’s take the same example we took earlier.

It’s not easy to see your portfolio crash by a third in just a few days.\\nRemember the first example we discussed. The pure equity portfolio went down from Rs 60 lakh to Rs 40 lakh. It’s not easy to bear a loss of Rs 20 lakh within a few months.\\nAnd that’s what gives asset allocation its importance.\\nAsset allocation can smoothen your wealth-creation journey. By allocating a certain percentage to debt, you can add a cushion to your portfolio.\\nAnd as we saw, you don’t have to give up significantly on the returns. Even a 60:40 portfolio is capable of getting you to your goals, of course, with much less volatility.\\nAnother advantage of asset allocation and rebalancing is that they automatically take care of the dilemma of when to invest more in equity and when to book profits.\\nFor instance, if you want a 70:30 asset allocation towards equity and debt and the market goes up in such a way that you have a 75:25 asset allocation, you can sell some equity and buy debt. This will take care of profit booking in overheated markets.\\nSimilarly, if this allocation becomes 65:35 during a bear run, you can shift some corpus from debt to equity. This will ensure that you buy equity when it’s cheap.\\nSo, you may have this question in your mind: Which asset allocation should you opt for?\\nHow do you decide whether to opt for 80:20, 70:30, or 60:40?\\nIt depends on many factors, including your age, risk profile, and time horizon for the goal.\\nConclusion\\nTo sum up, here are the virtues of asset allocation:\\nIt helps contain the downside in your portfolio by providing a cushion. It thus helps reduce portfolio risk.\\nIt takes care of the dilemma of when to book profits and when to invest more in equity.\\nIt helps reduce anxiety and thus helps one stay the course. With asset allocation, it’s easier to get to your goals.\\nWe hope the above article helped you understand the importance of asset allocation.\\nIf you have not started your investment journey yet then you can get started with ET Money.

              "  'content': 'In school, my favorite subjects were social studies, English, and Hindi. I especially had trouble with mathematics and science.\\nBut thanks to my core interests, my overall result was good enough.\\nThat time, I realized that I didn’t have to be outstanding in everything I did.\\nIf my core areas are solid, I will do well.\\nBut why are we talking about all this?\\nThe core fund or core portfolio is the main fund in your portfolio. The majority of your money is parked in this portion so, its performance drives the performance of the overall portfolio.\\nA core fund need not be a single fund. It can even be a couple of funds.\\nBut why do you need that? Can’t you have a few funds of various types, say, flexi-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, sectoral, thematic, etc., and just divide your money across them?\\nWhile there is no single way of managing or building a portfolio, the core-satellite approach is among the most popular philosophies in the investment world.\\nIn this approach, you have a couple of core funds, which command a large part of your portfolio, and then a couple of satellite funds.\\nThe core funds take care of the returns and the stability, and the satellite funds help boost the overall returns or help diversify better.\\nSo today, we will examine how you can create your core portfolio and which fund category you can pick. Broadly we will be covering three attributes.\\nWhy does a core fund matter for a good portfolio?\\nWhat are the attributes of a core fund, and what categories can qualify as core funds?\\nAmong the categories that qualify, which is the best option?\\nWhy does a core fund matter for a good portfolio?\\nHaving a core fund or funds has many advantages.\\nA core fund takes care of both the stability and returns of your overall portfolio. The satellite funds can then help boost returns or diversify better.\\nIt keeps you focused. You know exactly where to invest across market phases. If you don’t have a core fund, it’s easier to get lost\\nIt helps keep things simple. If you can’t spend much time tracking and tracing your portfolio, investing just in the core funds can help you achieve your goals.\\nIf you are an adventurous investor, it provides you the flexibility to experiment with your satellite portfolio. With the core of your portfolio being taken care of, even if some of your satellite funds don’t deliver as expected, you would still be largely fine.\\nSo, overall, having core funds in your portfolio can ease portfolio management and help you achieve your goals more efficiently.\\nBut which funds qualify as core funds? Let’s see.\\nBut before we begin, a quick thing, just like getting your funds right, is important, so is having the right term and health insurance. These make sure your dreams and wealth are protected from life’s uncertainties. And that’s why on ET Money, we have hand-picked term and health plans from top insurance companies. You can easily compare and buy them on the app. And if you need any help, our insurance experts are just one call away.\\nNow, let’s continue.\\nWhat categories can qualify as core funds?\\nOkay, the first question to find the answer to is which category of funds should qualify as core funds. Should it be from equity, or debt or a hybrid category?\\nNow, it’s well known that equity has the best return potential, and if you are in the accumulation phase, it has a crucial role in your portfolio.\\nSo, we decided to consider the equity fund category.\\nThis is not to say that debt funds or hybrid funds can’t be core funds. A debt fund can be a core fund in a retiree’s portfolio.\\nAnd if you are looking for automatic asset allocation, even a hybrid fund can be a core fund.\\nHowever, we will limit our discussion to equity funds as they are the natural choice in the accumulation phase.\\nBut, there are 11 equity fund categories, so which should qualify as core funds?\\nIn our view, a core fund should have two attributes:\\nIt should be able to generate good returns as well as provide stability to your portfolio.\\nIt should have minimal restrictions as to how it can invest.\\nBy good returns, we mean your returns must be similar to a broader index like NIFTY 50 or better than that.\\nBy stability, we mean limited volatility or ups and downs in your portfolio.\\nBut why should a core fund have greater freedom to invest, which is our second requisite?\\nBecause skewed mandates can increase portfolio risk and limit the benefits of diversification.\\nIf the fund must pick stocks of a certain kind only, it will do well only when stocks of that kind do well.\\nFor instance, a sectoral fund will do well only when the stocks of that particular sector do well.\\nIf they don’t, and that too for an extended period, your returns could suffer. Worse, if those stocks perform poorly, the fund will also do poorly, thanks to its concentration in such stocks.\\nThis is not something we would like to see in a core fund.\\nHence, we chose to pick only those fund categories with considerable freedom to invest anywhere.\\nWhen it comes to stability, large-cap stocks tend to be the most stable. So, we decided to pick only those categories that have a large-cap allocation of at least 50%.\\nAlso, we decided to exclude those categories that are mandated to invest only in a specific type of stock. Such categories have limited freedom to invest.\\nNow, let’s look at the various equity fund categories and find out which ones qualify.\\n\\n| Category          | Qualified/Disqualified   | Reason                                                                                                          |\\n|:------------------|:-------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Large-cap         | Qualified                | Have a large-cap exposure of at least 80%; no restrictions on the investment philosophy                         |\\n| Mid-cap           | Disqualified             | Large-cap exposure is less than 50%                                                                             |\\n| Large & mid-cap   | Qualified                | Average large-cap exposure over the last 3 years is more than 50%; no restrictions on the investment philosophy |\\n| Small-cap         | Disqualified             | Large-cap exposure is less than 50%                                                                             |\\n| Flexi-cap         | Qualified                | Average large-cap exposure over the last 3 years is more than 50%; no restrictions on the investment philosophy |\\n| Multi-cap         | Disqualified             | Average large-cap exposure over the last 2 years is less than 50%                                               |\\n| ELSS              | Qualified                | Average large-cap exposure over the last 3 years is more than 50%; no restrictions on the investment philosophy |\\n| Dividend yield    | Disqualified             | Must invest only as per the dividend theme                                                                      |\\n| Value/contra      | Disqualified             | Must invest only as per the value or contrarian theme                                                           |\\n| Focused           | Qualified                | Average large-cap exposure over the last 3 years is more than 50%; no restrictions on the investment philosophy |\\n| Sectoral/thematic | Disqualified             | Must invest only in a particular sector or theme                                                                |\\nOf the 11 categories, 6 couldn’t qualify. These include:\\nMid-cap\\nSmall-cap\\nMulti-cap\\nDividend Yield\\nValue/contra\\nSectoral/thematic\\nThese categories either had a large-cap allocation of less than 50% or some sort of restrictions on their investment mandate.\\nFor instance, value/contra funds must invest primarily based on the value or contrarian theme. Sectoral/thematic funds must invest primarily in a sector or a theme.\\nSo the categories that qualify include\\nLarge-cap\\nLarge & mid-cap\\nFlexi-cap\\nELSS\\nFocused\\nThese funds typically have a large-cap bias and minimal restrictions on their investment philosophy.\\nELSS or tax-saving funds are sort of miscellaneous here. These funds have a lock-in period of 3 years and are widely seen only as a tax-saving solution.\\nThat said, for those whose major investments are tax-saving investments only, ELSS can be an excellent option to build wealth, save tax, and act as the core fund of their portfolio.\\nHence, we have included them in our study.\\nLet’s now compare these 5 categories across various risk and return metrics and try to see which is the best.\\nWhich is the best core fund category?\\nTo measure returns, let’s use a parameter called rolling returns. Rolling returns measure performance across all specified time durations and hence indicate consistency of performance.\\nSince SEBI’s reclassification exercise happened only in 2017, after which many funds changed their mandates and the funds within a category became comparable, let’s take 3-year rolling returns between January 2018 and July 2023.\\nThis means all 3-year periods between these dates.\\nHere’s how the 5 categories compare in terms of 3-year average rolling returns. We have also included the Nifty 50 index for comparison purposes.\\nFocused funds are at the top, followed by large & mid-cap funds, flexi-cap funds and ELSS.\\nLarge-cap funds are the worst performers. They have done even worse than the Nifty 50 index.\\nOkay, because we are talking about returns, it would be worthwhile to see which category has delivered the highest 3-year rolling returns.\\nHere, large & mid-cap funds appear at the top. ELSS funds secure the next spot. Focused funds, which had appeared at the top earlier, are in the second-last spot.\\nThe Nifty 50 TRI is ahead of three categories.\\nSo, this was the returns picture of the 5 core fund categories.\\nWhat about the volatility of these returns? To measure that, we use a parameter called the standard deviation. The higher the standard deviation, the higher the volatility.\\nWe looked at the standard deviation of 3-year rolling returns. As you can see, focused funds have exhibited the lowest volatility, with their standard deviation being the same as the Nifty 50.\\nNext come large-cap funds, followed by flexi-cap funds. Large & mid-cap and ELSS funds have proved to be the most volatile.\\nNow, another parameter that we can use to check downside protection is the minimum 3-year rolling returns.\\nFocused funds have done a decent job here, too. Large & mid-cap funds and flexi-cap funds come next.\\nLarge-cap funds and the Nifty 50 index have fared poorly across this metric. So have ELSS funds.\\nWhat does this data tell us?\\nWell, If we see both the average returns and the volatility, focused funds clearly stand out.\\nThese funds have delivered higher returns at lower volatility.\\nThis is quite interesting as focused funds are likely riskier, given that these funds are mandated to invest in no more than 30 stocks. However, in reality, as of now, this doesn’t seem to be the case.\\nLarge-cap funds have failed to outperform the Nifty 50 index both in terms of average returns and volatility.\\nFlexi-cap funds lie right in the middle, both in terms of returns and risk.\\nGiven their higher mid-cap exposure, large & mid-cap funds exhibit a high risk-high return profile.\\nELSS funds have exhibited higher volatility for comparatively lower average returns.\\nWhich category should you pick, then? Let’s find out.\\nPicking the Right Core Fund\\nWell, this is the risk and return picture of the various core funds. Surely, you can use it to pick the right funds.\\nHowever, if you are building a portfolio, you will need to move beyond returns and focus on the broader picture.\\nLet’s see each of the core fund categories and assess for whom they are suitable.\\n1. Let’s start with large-cap funds\\nLarge-cap funds have a low return-low risk profile. They are suitable for someone who doesn’t want high volatility with their core funds.\\nHowever, given that most active large-cap funds are finding it difficult to beat the Nifty 50 index, it would be better to go with an index fund rather than an active large-cap fund.\\nIndex funds have another advantage: they take away the burden of picking the right type of fund.\\nWhen you pick index funds, you know you will get market-like returns. If the market does well, so will you. If it doesn’t, you wouldn’t either.\\nSo, in a way, they relieve you from the anxiety of going wrong with your fund pick.\\n2. Next come Large & Mid-Cap Funds\\nLarge & mid-cap funds are the aggressive choice for core funds, given their high mid-cap allocation. You can opt for them when returns are your primary focus.\\nHowever, if you have a separate allocation to mid-cap and small-cap funds in your satellite portfolio, you can do without them.\\nLarge & mid-cap funds in the core portfolio and mid-cap and small-cap funds in the satellite portfolio can increase a portfolio’s overall volatility as mid and small-caps tend to be more volatile.\\n3. Let’s now talk about flexi-cap funds\\nFlexi-cap funds are classic go-anywhere funds. These funds have exhibited moderate risk and reward and, hence can be a good complement to most portfolios.\\nIf you are not sure which fund you should pick as your core fund, you can simply pick a flexi-cap fund. Or if you think that your fund manager must have complete freedom in picking stocks, flexi-cap funds are the right choice.\\nHowever, if returns are your primary consideration, you have better options than flexi-cap funds\\n4. Next comes ELSS or tax-saving funds\\nThese funds can act as a core fund for anyone who is looking to save tax and build wealth.\\nHowever, if you don’t have tax-saving as a requirement or you have opted for the new tax regime, these funds could be of limited use.\\nThat said, their 3-year lock-in could be beneficial for investors who tend to sell out prematurely and find it difficult to stay put.\\n5. Last but not least: focused funds\\nFocused funds have emerged to be the best among all core funds. They have managed to deliver good returns while containing volatility.\\nAs such, they are suitable for any portfolio. However, if the concentration in these funds can make you uncomfortable, you can look to their more diversified flexi-cap peers.\\nSo, these are the broad guidelines that you can use to pick funds for your core portfolio.\\n\\n| Category              | Positives                       | Negatives                                              | Suitable for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\\n|:----------------------|:--------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Large-cap funds       | Low volatility                  | Low returns, even less than that of the Nifty 50 index | Active large-cap funds can be avoided altogether. Go with passive index funds if you want a low-volatility fund at the core of your portfolio. Go with them if you plan to have higher exposure to small and mid-cap funds in your satellite portfolio. Large-cap heavy core portfolio will take care of volatility. |\\n| Large & mid-cap funds | High returns                    | High volatility                                        | Those who want high returns from their core funds. If you don’t plan to add a significant amount to your satellite portfolio, then adding large and mid-cap funds to your core will help you boost returns.                                                                                                          |\\n| Flexi-cap funds       | Most versatile                  | Moderate returns                                       | Those who are not sure of which type of fund should be their core fund or those who want to give full freedom to their fund manager.                                                                                                                                                                                 |\\n| ELSS                  | Tax saving with wealth creation | Moderate returns at higher volatility                  | If tax-saving investments are your primary investments, then ELSS funds can act as good core funds. Their 3-year lock-in can help you stay put.                                                                                                                                                                      |\\nOf course, you can have funds from more than one category, depending on your requirements.\\nFor instance, an ELSS fund for tax-saving and a large & mid-cap fund for its return potential could be a possible combination.\\nIf you want a combination of active and passive, you can invest in a NIFTY 50 index fund along with a flexi-cap or a large & mid-cap fund.\\nAs we discussed earlier, you can choose to focus just on the core portfolio and leave the satellite portfolio altogether.\\nWhen you are holding more than one fund at the core of your portfolio, ensure that they are from different fund houses. It is critical to diversify across fund houses.\\nWe hope the above gave a good idea of how you can build a core section for your long-term portfolio.

              " {'Title': 'PPF Withdrawal\\xa0Rules: Partial & Complete Closure Rules',\n",
              "  'content': 'PPF, or the Public Provident Fund, is a household name in India.\\nAnd why not? Its many benefits make it the go-to investment option for many investors.\\nFor instance, in terms of taxation, it’s an EEE or exempt-exempt-exempt product.\\nThis means that the contributions in the PPF are tax-exempt, the interest earned is also tax-exempt, and the final maturity amount doesn’t get taxed either.\\nMoreover, whether you withdraw at maturity or before, the PPF enjoys the EEE status.\\nBut that’s not what we will cover today in this article.\\nInstead, we will look at what happens when your PPF account matures after 15 years.\\nWe will also talk about what happens if you want to close your PPF account before it matures. And discuss a scenario wherein you want to make a premature withdrawal.\\nThis article is divided into 4 sections:\\nWhat can you do with your PPF account post-maturity?\\nHow can you make premature withdrawals from your PPF account?\\nHow can you close your account before its tenure of 15 years?\\nWhen is a PPF account discontinued and what can you do about it?\\nBut first, let’s take a quick look at the key features of the PPF.\\n\\n| Criterion                | Details                                                                            |\\n|:-------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Who can invest?          | A resident Indian; a guardian on the behalf of a minor or a person of unsound mind |\\n| How much can you invest? | Minimum: Rs 500; Maximum: Rs 1.5 lakh in a financial year                          |\\n| Returns                  | Notified every quarter; currently, 7.1%                                            |\\n| Tenure                   | 15 years                                                                           |\\n| Tax benefits             | 80C tax exemption of up to Rs 1.5 lakh in a financial year; EEE status             |\\nLet’s start with the first section now: what happens with your PPF account post maturity?\\n1. What happens to PPF account after maturity?\\nThe tenure of a PPF account is 15 years.\\nTo be precise, it’s actually more than that because the period is calculated from the end of the financial year in which the deposit is made.\\nSo, if you make your first deposit in August 2023, the tenure will be calculated from the end of the financial year in March 2024. Consequently, your 15 years tenure will be completed on April 1, 2039, and not August 2038.\\nBut what happens at the end of it?\\nWell, you have three options:\\nThe first is pretty straightforward. You withdraw the entire money and close the account.\\nThe second option is that you can continue your PPF account without contributing to it so that whatever investments you have made continue to grow.\\nAnd then there’s a third option. In this, you continue the PPF account beyond 15 years and keep investing like you have been doing.\\nIn the second and the third option, the account can be extended in blocks of 5 years for any number of times.\\nLet’s understand these options one by one.\\nThis is a simple process.\\nYou just need to fill up and submit the account closure form at your bank or at the post office where you have your PPF account.\\nYou can apply for the account closure and withdrawal of the corpus once your PPF account matures after 15 years.\\nNow, who should go for this option?\\nIf you need the money after your PPF account matures, you can withdraw it and close the account. Or if you have a goal due for which you had been saving in the PPF, you can withdraw the amount.\\nNow, let’s talk about the scenario wherein you don’t want to withdraw the money. For example, you may have started the PPF when you were 30 years old. It will mature by the time you are 46. At that time, most people are at the peak of their careers. So, you may want the money 10 or 15 years later, close to your retirement.\\nIf you want to extend your PPF, there are two options, as we mentioned earlier:\\nFirst, you don’t invest fresh money.\\nSecond, you continue your contributions.\\nLet’s understand these two options in detail as each of these have some conditions that you need to fulfil. The conditions are simple. But you must know them so that you can accordingly plan your finances.\\nRegulations allow you to extend the PPF account in blocks of 5 years only. You can extend it as many times as you want by filling up the required forms.\\nWhen you choose to extend ‘without contribution’, you will continue to earn interest during these 5 years and you don’t have to make any additional contributions.\\nSo what are the conditions in this case?\\nOnce you decide to extend without contribution, you will need to stick to it. You cannot suddenly decide to contribute to your PPF.\\nIf you do make any contributions, they will be treated as ‘irregular’ and will be refunded. You won’t get any tax benefits for such contributions.\\nYou can withdraw any amount. But you can do this only once in a financial year.\\nSo, if you have Rs 50 lakh in your PPF account, you can withdraw Rs 1,000 or Rs 20 lakh or any other amount; the choice is entirely yours.\\nWhen should you opt for this option?\\nSo, who should go for an extension of the PPF account without contribution?\\nIn general, if you don’t need the money and are happy with the PPF as an investment avenue, you can continue.\\nIf you had made the PPF investment with a specific goal in mind and the goal is still a few years away, you can choose to stay invested and earn more returns.\\nFor instance, you need the PPF money in your retirement, and when the PPF account matures, your retirement is still a few years away. In that case, you can continue to stay invested.\\nIf you want to continue contributing to the PPF account after the completion of 15 years, you can opt for this option.\\nLet’s understand the conditions under this option.\\nYou will need to opt for this option within one year from the maturity of your PPF account. If you don’t choose this within time, you cannot opt for it at a later date.\\nThe second condition is about withdrawals. Remember, when you choose the ‘without contribution’ option, you can make withdrawals only once in a financial year from your PPF account. The same thing is applicable when you extend with contribution. However, you can’t withdraw just any amount you wish.\\nYou can withdraw only up to 60% of the amount at the start of the five-year extension period. Let’s understand this with an example.\\nIf you had Rs 50 lakh in your PPF when you opted for an extension, you can withdraw up to Rs 30 lakh only. You can either withdraw this in one go or in multiple tranches. But there can be just one withdrawal in a financial year.\\nThe table on your screen compares the two options.\\n\\n| Criteria             | Without contribution                | With contribution                                                 |\\n|:---------------------|:------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Eligibility          | Completion of 15 years              | Completion of 15 years                                            |\\n| Automatic conversion | Yes                                 | No                                                                |\\n| Withdrawal amount    | Any amount up to 100% of corpus     | Only up to 60% of the corpus at the start of the extension period |\\n| Withdrawal frequency | Once a financial year               | Once a financial year                                             |\\n| Fresh contributions  | Not allowed                         | Up to Rs 1.5 lakh in a financial year                             |\\n| Returns              | As per the prevailing interest rate | As per the prevailing interest rate                               |\\nWho should go for this option?\\nIf you started contributing to PPF early in your career, you can opt for this option.\\nThere was an example we discussed earlier where a person starts PPF at the age of 30, and it matures when he turns 46.\\nSo, extension with contribution will help such investors to benefit from the compounding of PPF.\\nLet’s say you invest Rs 12,500 in PPF every month.\\nIf you get an average of 7% returns through the investment tenure, you will end up with a kitty of around Rs 40 lakh.\\nOn the other hand, if you continue to do this for 25 years, you will accumulate Rs 1 crore.\\nIf you do this for 30 years, you will end up with Rs 1.5 crore.\\nThat’s how compounding works. The more time you give your investment to grow, the better corpus you get to accumulate.\\nNow, let’s move to the next section of this article: premature withdrawals from your PPF account.\\n2. How to make premature withdrawals from your PPF account?\\nOkay, so your PPF account hasn’t completed 15 years, but you are in need of funds. What can you do?\\nOf course, you can withdraw from your PPF account, and as we saw at the beginning of this article, these premature withdrawals are also tax-free. So, you don’t need to worry about the taxes.\\nBut these withdrawals are not so straightforward.\\nFirst, you can make premature withdrawals from your PPF account only after the completion of 5 years.\\nDo note that 5 years means 5 completed financial years starting from the end of the financial year in which you made your first deposit.\\nSo, technically, premature withdrawals are possible only from the 7th year of making the investment.\\nFor example, if you make your first PPF investment in August 2023, you can make a premature withdrawal only after April 1, 2029.\\nThere are some other requisites as well.\\nOne, you can make only one premature withdrawal in a financial year.\\nTwo, you can withdraw either up to 50% of the account balance at the end of the financial year or 50% of the amount at the end of the fourth financial year preceding the year of application, whichever is lower.\\nFor instance, if you make a premature withdrawal request in August 2023 and your PPF account has completed at least 5 financial years, you will get either 50% of the corpus at the end of FY23 or at the end of FY20, whichever is lower.\\nWhat if you need to make a withdrawal before 5 years? Well, that’s not possible. But you sure can opt for a loan against your PPF balance.\\nLet’s now talk about the premature closure of your PPF account.\\n3. How to close your PPF account before 15 years?\\nWe know that the maturity of a PPF account is 15 years. But what if you want to close it before that? Is it even possible?\\nYes, it is possible, but there are multiple conditions.\\nFirst, you can close a PPF account only after it has completed 5 financial years.\\nSecond, it can be closed only for certain specified reasons. These include\\nTreatment of life-threatening disease of the account holder, their spouse or dependent children or parents\\nHigher education of the account holder or dependent children\\nA change in residency status of the account holder\\nFor each of these cases, appropriate documents have to be provided. For example, if you are closing the PPF account due to a change in residency status, a copy of your passport, visa, and income-tax return is needed.\\nDo note that when you prematurely close your account, the interest on your account is recalculated at a rate lower by 1%. This is applicable since the date of account opening or extension, as applicable.\\nSo, if you have been getting, say, 8% interest on the PPF all through the tenure, your interest will be recalculated at 7%.\\nThis 1% can add up to a lot in the long run.\\nFor instance, if you ran your PPF account for 10 years, invested Rs 1.5 lakh in it on April 1 each year, and earned 8% per annum, your corpus will be Rs 23.46 lakh\\nNow, if you decide to close your account prematurely, the entire calculation will be done at 7%. So, your corpus will get reduced to Rs 22.17 lakh\\nSo, you will get around 1.29 lakh less.\\nNow, the PPF account is also prematurely closed in case of the death of the account holder The proceeds are paid to the legal heir. However, the heir cannot continue running the account.\\nThis brings us to the last section in this article: when is a PPF account discontinued? Let’s take a look.\\n4. What to do if your PPF account has been discontinued?\\nTo keep your PPF account active, you must deposit at least Rs 500 in it in a financial year.\\nIf you fail to do that, your account will be discontinued or deactivated.\\nTo revive a deactivated account, you will need to pay Rs 50 + Rs 500 for each of the financial years during which the account has remained deactivated.\\nAs you would recall, this Rs 500 is the minimum contribution amount for the PPF.\\nFor instance, if your account has stayed deactivated for 2 financial years, you will need to pay Rs 1,100 – Rs 100 as the penalty and Rs 1,000 as the minimum contribution.\\nIf an account has been discontinued, you cannot make premature withdrawals from it. Neither can you take a loan on such an account.\\nYou cannot even open a new PPF account until you properly close a deactivated account.\\nHowever, a discontinued PPF account continues to earn interest.\\nWith this, we have come to the end of this article.\\nWe hope you found the information helpful and it will help you better manage your PPF.\\n'},\n",
              " {'Title': 'Multicap Funds – The better way to Invest in Mid & Small Caps?',\n",
              "  'content': 'Mid- and small-cap funds are among the most sought-after investments.\\nAnd there is a good reason for that. Mid and small-cap companies have a higher return potential than large caps. But they come with a problem. The problem is that they are highly volatile.\\nAnd so most people invest in mid and small-cap funds looking at past returns, only to realize during choppy markets that they can’t tolerate the wild swings in investments they have in these funds and exit.\\nThat’s why even though you see some astonishing returns of funds in these two categories, only a few investors make that kind of return.\\nSo, is there a better way to take exposure to mid and small-caps?\\nThat’s exactly what we will cover in this article.\\nHere, we will analyze whether multi-cap funds are a ‘better’ way to take exposure to mid and small-caps.\\nCan multi-cap funds give you high returns like mid and small-caps with lesser volatility?\\nAnd this analysis is quite unique as we created our proxy multi-cap fund since there isn’t enough data on the performance of multi cap funds.\\nNow you could be wondering why we are looking at multi-cap funds as a substitute for mid and small-cap funds.\\nThere is a good reason. Let’s first understand that.\\nSubstitutes For Mid-cap And Small-Cap Funds\\nThere are some mutual fund categories where the fund managers have complete liberty to invest anywhere they wish.\\nDepending on the market conditions, they can invest in large-cap, mid-cap, or small-cap stocks. And so they have the flexibility to invest a large chunk of your money in mid or small-caps if they wish.\\nNow, there are seven such categories: flexi-cap, multi-cap, large and mid-caps, ELSS, value/contra, focused and thematic/sector funds.\\nHowever, of these, only three don’t have restrictions in terms of the lock-in, number of stocks, investment philosophy, and investment space.\\nThese are flexi-cap funds, large & mid-cap funds, and multi-cap funds. We have now zeroed in on three categories. Let’s talk about them further.\\nFlexi-cap funds can invest in companies of any size in any proportion.\\nMulti-cap funds must compulsorily invest at least 25% each in large, mid, and small caps.\\nAnd lastly, Large & mid-cap funds must invest at least 35% each in large and mid-caps. They are not mandated to invest in small caps, but they have room to do so.\\nSo, in theory, these three diversified categories can get you exposure to mid and small-caps. They don’t have any other restrictions.\\nBut things are not as simple as they seem.\\nThe chart above shows the flexi cap category’s average allocation to different market caps at the end of each quarter since 2020. As you can see, their large-cap exposure has averaged around 66% over the last 3 years.\\nSo by the looks of it, they don’t invest a big part of their corpus in mid-and small-cap stocks. And therefore might not be the best category if you are looking for decent mid- and small-cap exposure.\\nLet’s now talk about large & mid-cap funds.\\nThanks to their mandate, these schemes have a sizable allocation to mid-caps, but their exposure to small caps is quite low. It has averaged just 7.42% over the last 3 years.\\nSo, This leaves us with only multi-cap funds. With their mandated exposure of at least 25% in all market caps, these funds will always have at least 50% in mid and small caps.\\nThis is the reason why they could be a good proxy to invest in mid-and small-cap stocks. That’s what it feels, at least in theory.\\nOne more reason why we decided to analyze the multi-cap category as a good proxy for investing in mid- and small-cap funds is their recent returns.\\nIn the past six months, there has been a rally in mid-and small-cap stocks. This is reflected in the returns of not only mid-cap and small-cap funds but also in multi-cap funds.\\nHere are some numbers. In the past three months, the average returns of multi-cap funds have been about 14%. Mid-cap and small-cap funds have given about 16% and 17%, respectively.\\n\\n| Category   |   Average 3-month returns (%) |   Average 6-month returns (%) |\\n|:-----------|------------------------------:|------------------------------:|\\n| Mid cap    |                         15.84 |                         11.17 |\\n| Small cap  |                         17.18 |                         13.47 |\\n| Multi cap  |                         14    |                          9.46 |\\nAnd if you compare multi-cap fund category returns with other diversified categories, you will see why we think they could be a proxy to mid caps and small caps. In the past three and six months, they have had the highest average returns across all categories.\\n\\n| Category        |   Average 3-month returns (%) |   Average 6-month returns (%) |\\n|:----------------|------------------------------:|------------------------------:|\\n| Multi Cap       |                         14    |                          9.46 |\\n| Large & Mid Cap |                         13.56 |                          8.91 |\\n| Contra          |                         12.45 |                          9.28 |\\n| Value Funds     |                         12.77 |                          8.87 |\\n| Flexi Cap       |                         12.95 |                          8.31 |\\n| ELSS            |                         12.45 |                          8.04 |\\n| Focused         |                         12.63 |                          7.79 |\\n| Large Cap       |                         11.57 |                          7.03 |\\nSo, there is a trend, so we decided to look deeper into it. But before we go any further, it’s essential to know a few things about these funds.\\nWe don’t obviously expect multi-cap funds to beat mid-cap and small-cap funds. Multi-caps have a good allocation to large-cap stocks. So, they may or may not do better than mid-cap and small-cap funds.\\nWith over 50% in mid-caps and small-caps, we want to see if multi-cap funds can participate in their rally, giving investors higher returns. And achieve better returns with lower volatility than mid-cap and small-cap funds.\\nBut first, let’s take a quick look at the background of multi-cap funds.\\nBackground of multi-cap funds\\nThe history of multi-cap funds is slightly confusing.\\nThese funds have always been there if we just go by the name ‘multi-cap’. The category has been there for a while, and they were allowed to invest in companies of all sizes and any proportion.\\nHowever, most multi-cap funds were large-cap-heavy and had minimal mid and small caps exposure. They weren’t ‘multi-cap’ in essence.\\nSo, in September 2020, SEBI came out with a rule that multi-cap funds should be true to label and therefore must have at least 25% each in large, mid, and small caps.\\nBut this move created a problem for the industry. Many multi-cap funds at that time had big allocation to large caps, and shifting that to mid and small-caps to comply with the revised multi-cap mandate would have caused quite a lot of issues.\\nSo, SEBI introduced the flexi-cap category. And most AMCs reclassified their multi-cap funds as flexi caps and then launched new multi-cap funds\\nIn short, what were multi-caps earlier are now known as flexi caps in most cases. The multi-cap category currently has 21 funds.\\nNow, let’s get back to analyzing these funds.\\nGiven that this category is new, we had to develop a special method to assess multi-caps.\\nLet’s understand what it is and how we did it.\\nMulti Cap Category Simulation\\nSince there is limited data on multi-caps, any concrete analysis was not possible.\\nSo, we decided to simulate the performance of a multi-cap fund.\\nWe created our multi-cap fund and then studied the performance of this multi-cap fund for the long term. This will give us a fair idea of what to expect from multi-cap schemes.\\nThis fund that we created is similar to the existing multi-cap funds. Let me explain how we did it.\\nFirst, we used three indices to create this multi-cap fund. The 3 indices are – Nifty 100 TRI, Nifty Midcap 150 TRI and Nifty Smallcap 250 TRI.\\nBecause equity funds also have a cash component, we took SBI Liquid Fund as the proxy. SBI Liquid is the largest liquid fund as of June 2023. It is also one of the oldest in the category.\\nNext, we had to decide in what proportion these indices should be in our multi-cap fund.\\nTo find that, we found out the average market-cap allocation of multi-cap funds over the last 2 years.\\nOn average, multi-cap funds have invested around 42% in large caps, 26% and 27% in mid and small caps, respectively. They have had about 6% cash.\\nLarge caps: 41.66%\\nMid caps: 26.06%\\nSmall caps: 26.68%\\nOthers/cash: 6.46%\\nSo, we decided to use the same asset allocation for our proxy multi-cap fund.\\nNifty 100 TRI: 42%\\nNifty Midcap 150 TRI: 26%\\nNifty Smallcap 250 TRI: 26%\\nSBI Liquid Fund: 6%\\nTo maintain this allocation, the proxy multi-cap fund was rebalanced on January 1 every year.\\nAnd then, we studied the performance of this proxy multi-cap fund against the Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Smallcap 250 indices between June 2013 and June 2023.\\nWhat did we find? Let’s see.\\nComparing Returns\\nWe will start by comparing the returns of our proxy multi-cap fund with those of the Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Smallcap 250 indices.\\nLet’s start with the trailing returns. See the chart on your screen.\\nWhile the proxy multi-cap fund didn’t come out on top every time, it was able to outperform the small-cap index across five- and seven-year periods.\\nThe mid-cap index has had the best run based on this metric. It appeared at the top in 3 of the 4 periods.\\nAnother useful parameter for measuring returns is rolling returns, as you measure performance across time for all possible combinations.\\nSo, in the case of 5-year rolling returns, it would be across any five-year period over a specified time band.\\nThe chart below shows the average, maximum, and minimum returns of the mid-cap index, the small-cap index, and the proxy multi-cap portfolio.\\nAs you can see, while our multi-cap portfolio did better than the small-cap index in terms of average 5-year rolling returns and minimum 5-year rolling returns, the mid-cap index has again stolen the show.\\nSo, the proxy multi-cap fund is quite a competition for the small-cap index. However, as compared to the mid-cap index, its performance is wanting.\\nLet’s now talk about the volatility of the multi-cap portfolio vis-a-vis the mid-cap and the small-cap indices.\\nComparing Volatility\\nDiscussion of returns without looking at volatility is only half the picture.\\nIn an ideal world, you want high returns with no volatility or absolute certainty.\\nSadly that doesn’t happen. Often, the higher the return potential, the more volatility is involved.\\nWe checked the volatility of the five-year rolling returns by looking at the standard deviation. The higher the standard deviation, the higher the volatility.\\nDownside Protection\\nSo, we wanted to check here if the multi-cap portfolio offers better downside protection than mid-cap and small-cap indices.\\nTo do so, we first defined what a downside is. For that, we considered those quarterly periods over the last 10 years when the Nifty 50 gave negative returns.\\nWe then checked the returns of the proxy multi-cap portfolio, the mid-cap index, and the small-cap index across all such quarters.\\nThe table below shows the result.\\n\\n| Quarter ended   |   Nifty 50 |   Nifty Midcap 150 |   Nifty Smallcap 250 |   Proxy multi-cap portfolio |\\n|:----------------|-----------:|-------------------:|---------------------:|----------------------------:|\\n| 01-Apr-2020     |     -32.03 |             -30.17 |               -34.83 |                      -29.97 |\\n| 01-Jul-2022     |     -10.33 |             -10.43 |               -15.59 |                      -11.05 |\\n| 02-Jan-2017     |      -6.26 |              -8.44 |                -7.79 |                       -6.92 |\\n| 01-Oct-2015     |      -5.62 |              -0.59 |                 0.34 |                       -2    |\\n| 03-Apr-2023     |      -4.3  |              -4.61 |                -7.15 |                       -5.46 |\\n| 01-Oct-2019     |      -3.8  |              -8.06 |               -10.32 |                       -5.98 |\\n| 01-Apr-2016     |      -2.89 |              -6.84 |               -12.06 |                       -6.25 |\\n| 02-Apr-2018     |      -1.77 |              -8.12 |               -12.02 |                       -6.14 |\\n| 01-Oct-2013     |      -1.62 |              -4.32 |                -5.86 |                       -3.36 |\\n| 01-Jul-2015     |      -1.15 |              -0.56 |                -3.13 |                       -1.08 |\\n| 01-Jan-2019     |      -0.7  |               3.5  |                 3.58 |                        1.6  |\\nOut of the 11 periods, the multi-cap portfolio did better than the mid-cap and small-cap indices in 6. That’s more than 50% of the time.\\nNext comes the mid-cap index, and the last, as you may have expected, is the small-cap index.\\nSo, overall, the multi-cap proxy portfolio provided decent downside protection thanks to its decent large-cap exposure.\\nConclusion\\nThe table below summarises our analysis\\n\\n| Criteria   | vs Nifty Midcap 150 TRI   | vs Nifty Smallcap TRI   |\\n|:-----------|:--------------------------|:------------------------|\\n| Returns    | Less                      | Competitive             |\\n| Volatility | Slightly less             | Less                    |\\nSo, the proxy multi-cap fund has a competitive return profile with respect to the small-cap index but is not as good as that of the mid-cap index.\\nIn terms of volatility and downside protection, they are better than both the mid-cap and small-cap indices.\\nOverall, the proxy multi-cap portfolio has provided decent performance with comparatively lesser volatility and better downside protection.\\nDoes it mean you should invest in multi-cap funds?\\nOur study was based on some assumptions, which we mentioned at the start of this video. It’s very likely that the real-world experience will be different.\\nFor example, we rebalanced the portfolio only once a year. In real life, a fund manager has no such obligation. Also, we took the average asset allocation to determine index weights in the proxy multi-cap portfolio.\\nIn real life, funds can have different asset allocations, and a fund’s asset allocation can change across the spectrum.\\nSo, don’t expect that you will get exactly the same results in real life as in this study. Consider it to be indicative. Some funds would do better than this, and some would do worse.\\nBut one thing is clear. Don’t write off multi-cap funds.\\nThey can be a good option to take exposure to mid and small caps, reduce volatility, and get better downside protection.\\nMore importantly, they could be a useful option to allocate assets across market caps so that you always have exposure to all market caps.\\nSuch a thing is only readily possible with flexi-cap, large & mid-cap, and other diversified equity funds as they tend to be skewed too in terms of market cap or investment philosophy and approach.\\nIf you have not started your investment journey in equity markets, then you can get started with ET Money.

              "  'content': 'As investors, we all go through a learning curve. We get better with experience and learn from our mistakes. But sometimes, we don’t even realize the mistakes we have been making. And because we don’t realize it, we keep bearing the cost of that mistake.\\nThis article delves into the common mistakes people make when investing in mutual funds and provides valuable insights on how to steer clear of them. Avoiding these inadvertent errors is crucial, as they can significantly impact your returns.\\nSo, let’s begin.\\n1. Chasing Performance\\nChasing performance is a mistake most of us have made. After all, it’s really tempting to see a fund give high double-digit returns and invest in it, hoping that its dream run will continue and one will earn those returns.\\nUnfortunately, in most cases, it doesn’t happen. That’s because top performers change every year.\\nTake a look at the table below. It shows the top equity funds of the last 10 years.\\n\\n|   Year | Fund 1                       | Fund 2                     | Fund 3                         |\\n|-------:|:-----------------------------|:---------------------------|:-------------------------------|\\n|   2013 | ICICI Pru Technology         | SBI Technology Opp         | Franklin India Technology      |\\n|   2014 | SBI Small Cap                | Sundaram Small Cap         | UTI Transportation & Logistics |\\n|   2015 | SBI Healthcare Opp           | SBI Small Cap              | DSP Small Cap                  |\\n|   2016 | DSP Natural Res & New Energy | SBI Magnum Comma           | Tata Resources & Energy        |\\n|   2017 | SBI Small Cap                | Tata India Consumer        | HSBC Small Cap                 |\\n|   2018 | Tata Digital India           | ICICI Pru Technology       | SBI Technology Opp             |\\n|   2019 | ICICI Pru US Bluechip Equity | Nippon India US Equity Opp | 360 ONE Focused Equity         |\\n|   2020 | Union Midcap                 | DSP Healthcare             | Mirae Asset Healthcare         |\\n|   2021 | Quant Small Cap              | Quant Infrastructure       | HSBC Small Cap                 |\\n|   2022 | Aditya Birla SL PSU Equity   | SBI PSU                    | ICICI Pru Infrastructure       |\\n|   2023 | ICICI Pru NASDAQ 100 Index   | Nippon India Taiwan Equity | ICICI Pru Nifty Auto Index     |\\nAs you can see, all sorts of funds have been top performers in the last 10 years.\\nThere are sectoral funds, thematic funds, small-cap funds, international funds and what not.\\nNow, if you were going to chase performance, you would invest in the year’s top performers, which means a lot of churn in your portfolio.\\nBut is this churning worth it? Let’s look at the numbers\\nLet’s say, at the start of 2014, you invested Rs 1 lakh each in the top performers of 2013.\\nOn January 1, 2015, you redeemed this money and invested it in the top performers of 2014.\\nSo, every year, you kept investing in the top performer of the previous year by redeeming money from the existing funds at that point in time. You kept doing so until 2023.\\nHow would your returns compare with someone who invested Rs 3 lakh in the Nifty 50 and Nifty 500 at the start of 2014?\\nSee the chart below. (For simplicity, we have considered pre-tax returns)\\nSo chasing the performance approach doesn’t seem to have delivered massive outperformance. Compared to the Nifty 500, the extra returns are just a few thousand, and that is before taxes.\\nSo, if someone had just invested in NIFTY 500, he would have done well.\\nThat means no buying-selling, tracking the best funds, or tolerating the inherent volatility of thematic/sectoral and small-cap funds.\\nLet’s talk about the Nifty 50 now.\\nThere is a difference of about Rs 1 lakh compared to the corpus created in Nifty 50, but remember, Nifty 50 is a large-cap index.\\nOn the other hand, the top performers were funds that were supposed to have a higher return potential. And that’s why they appeared on the table you saw earlier.\\nSo, given that, the difference is not big enough.\\nWith the Nifty 50, you would have also experienced less volatility along the way as compared to the other funds.\\nNot to forget that you would not have been required to do anything during the period. You just invested and stayed there.\\nIt’s like taking 10 different rides to reach your destination faster. But in the end, you realize it possibly was not worth the extra effort. You could have stayed in the same car/train and reached just a few minutes later.\\nNow, let’s take another scenario.\\nHow would the returns compare if, instead of the Nifty 50 and Nifty 500, you had invested in an index with higher return potential but was more volatile?\\nRefer to the chart below. If we compare the returns from chasing the top performer with the mid-cap index, the difference is huge and in favor of the mid-cap index.\\nThat means if someone is willing to take a higher risk, going with the plain mid-cap index is far more rewarding than chasing the best performer.\\nOverall, there are better alternatives to performance-chasing as the best performing funds keep on changing.\\n2. Investing In Sectoral/thematic Funds\\nFrom time to time, different sectors and themes do well in the market.\\nMany investors are attracted to sectoral and thematic funds due to their short-term returns.\\nHowever, investing in these funds is riskier than investing in diversified equity funds.\\nA major challenge of investing in sectoral and thematic funds is guessing which theme will work.\\nNot many investors can boast of getting that correct. What adds to this problem is that the top sectors or themes keep changing.\\nIf you refer to the table below, it shows the top-performing sectors over the last 10 years.\\n\\n|   nan | Sector 1    | Sector 2          | Sector 3          |   nan |\\n|------:|:------------|:------------------|:------------------|------:|\\n|  2013 | IT          | Pharma            | FMCG              |   nan |\\n|  2014 | PSU banking | Banking & Finance | Pharma            |   nan |\\n|  2015 | Media       | Pharma            | FMCG              |   nan |\\n|  2016 | Metal       | Banking & Finance | FMCG              |   nan |\\n|  2017 | Realty      | Metal             | Banking & Finance |   nan |\\n|  2018 | IT          | FMCG              | Banking & Finance |   nan |\\n|  2019 | Realty      | Banking & Finance | Services          |   nan |\\n|  2020 | Pharma      | IT                | Metal             |   nan |\\n|  2021 | Power       | Metal             | Utilities         |   nan |\\n|  2022 | Power       | Banking           | Industrials       |   nan |\\n|  2023 | Defence     | Realty            | Auto              |   nan |\\nA quick look reveals that the top 3 sectors have changed quite frequently..\\nSo, even if you have identified the right sector, there are slim chances that that sector will remain at the top.\\nYou might say that it doesn’t matter that a sector should remain in the top 3.

The top funds change, so different themes have performed well in different periods.\\nAnother challenge with thematic funds is that funds following the same theme can give very different returns, depending on how the fund manager picks stocks.\\nTake a look at the table on your screen. It shows the returns of various consumption funds in 2022.\\nThe consumption theme has the largest number of funds in the thematic category.\\n\\n| Fund                                         |   2022 return (%) |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n|:---------------------------------------------|------------------:|------:|------:|------:|\\n| Nippon India Consumption Fund                |             15.71 |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| SBI Consumption Opportunities Fund           |             15.06 |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| ICICI Prudential Bharat Consumption Fund     |             10.98 |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| Sundaram Consumption Fund                    |             10.39 |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| Mahindra Manulife Consumption Fund           |              9.53 |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| Mirae Asset Great Consumer Fund              |              8.89 |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| ICICI Prudential Nifty India Consumption ETF |              8.3  |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| Nippon India ETF Nifty India Consumption     |              8.16 |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| Axis NIFTY India Consumption ETF             |              8.11 |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| SBI Nifty Consumption ETF                    |              8.09 |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| Canara Robeco Consumer Trends Fund           |              7.6  |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| Aditya Birla Sun Life India GenNext Fund     |              6.34 |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| Baroda BNP Paribas India Consumption Fund    |              6.31 |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\n| Tata India Consumer Fund                     |              2.38 |   nan |   nan |   nan |\\nAs you can see, the returns range from about 16% to – 2%. And this trend is not limited only to this thematic category.\\nSo, even if you have spotted the right theme, you can’t be sure that the chosen fund will outperform.\\nSo, what should you do?\\nTaking calls on specific sectors or themes is not your job as a mutual fund investor. That’s what your fund manager should do.\\nSo, if a sector or a theme is up-and-coming, it will also find a place in a diversified equity fund, as your fund manager will pick stocks from it.\\nYou don’t have to do it yourself. If you do it yourself, you will probably just increase your risk.\\nNow let’s talk about the next mistake: going overboard on mid- and small-cap funds\\n3. Investing heavily in mid- and small-cap funds\\nLike sectoral and thematic funds, mid- and small-cap funds attract a lot of attention.\\nIn bull runs, these funds tend to give amazing returns, and many investors find that too difficult to ignore.\\nSo, it’s obvious that people would want to invest in mid-cap and small-cap funds.\\nBut these funds are not meant for everyone.\\nOnly if you are willing to take higher risk for better returns should you invest in mid- and small-cap funds.\\nIf you are someone who doesn’t like too many ups and downs in your portfolio, you can very well remain with diversified equity funds.\\nTo better understand this risk-return equation, let’s look at the 5-year rolling returns from 2013 of Nifty 50, Nifty 500, Nifty Mid cap 150, and Nifty Small cap 250\\nNow, the mid-cap index has delivered the best performance. Nifty 50 and Nifty 500 have done a decent job, while the small-cap index has failed to impress.\\nBut one should not see returns alone. Returns should be seen in conjunction with the ensuing volatility.\\nIf you had to tolerate more ups and downs to get one to two percentage points extra, perhaps the extra returns are not as appealing.\\nSo how volatile are all the indices we mentioned above? For this, we looked at their standard deviation. The higher the standard deviation, the more volatility.\\nAs you might have guessed, mid- and small caps are quite volatile. Notably, the small-cap index has proved to be the most volatile and hasn’t delivered either.\\nHence, invest in the mid-and small-cap categories, especially the small-cap ones, only after much thought. A large allocation to mid- and small-cap funds in your portfolio can make it swing wildly with market winds.\\nIf you do decide to invest in them, avoid not putting more than 30% of the worth of your portfolio in them.\\nLet’s now talk about the next mistake: not reviewing your portfolio.\\n4. Not reviewing your portfolio\\nYet another common mistake that investors make is that they don’t review their portfolio periodically.\\nThis is essential. It helps you to cut down on risks and problems. And this can help you boost your returns.\\nLet me give you one example from my portfolio. In 2014, I started investing in a tax saving fund. (Aditya Birla SL ELSS Tax Relief 96) It was doing quite well at that time. For three years, the fund outperformed NIFTY 50 and NIFTY 500.\\nBut from 2018 onwards, it started slipping. It has underperformed the benchmark since then. I waited for four years of continuous underperformance to stop my SIPs. So, finally, I stopped investing in it in 2022. I will be able to withdraw from it entirely by 2025. Until then, I am stuck with it.\\nIf I had reviewed my portfolio regularly, I could have stopped my SIPs earlier in 2020 or 2021 after two to three years of underperformance. And I could have possibly exited the fund entirely this year. My portfolio returns would have been slightly better.\\nBut portfolio review is not only about looking at underperforming funds. For example, you check for exposure to different asset classes when reviewing your portfolio. You see, if you have too many funds in the same category. You can even go much deeper to see if your funds complement each other and whether the fund strategy has changed over the years.\\nOver the years, I have realized that there’s nothing as a perfect or a hopeless portfolio. There are only optimized and unoptimized portfolios. And the difference between the two could be significant.\\nLet’s now see how not reviewing your portfolio can compromise the quality of your portfolio.\\nWe all know that the top funds keep changing every few years. A fund giving you high returns for the past three-four years can suddenly start underperforming. And it can continue to do so for years to come.\\nSee the chart on your screen.\\nThis chart could be a bit technical. It shows the percent of funds across categories that have fallen from the top quartile, or the top 25% in terms of returns, over the last two years.\\nTo put it simply, it shows how the top-performing funds change every two years. For example, in the large-cap category, most top funds change every two years. On the other hand, in the ELSS category, the top-performing funds don’t change as often in two years.\\nSo, even if you have picked good funds, you should regularly monitor your portfolio.\\nOf course, a slight deterioration in the fund’s performance over the short term is no cause for concern. However, if a fund continues to underperform for two years or more, you should consider exiting it.\\nYou can find tools available on ET Money to help you with this. The Fund Report Card can help to understand whether the fund is worth investing. Then there is a Portfolio Health Check which gives a thorough portfolio analysis, which can be a good starting point.\\nLet’s now move to the next point: not starting with a financial plan.\\n5. Not starting with a financial plan\\nMany of us start investing right away without first giving a thought to what we want to achieve with our investments.\\nThat is to say, we don’t have a financial plan in place.\\nJust think of this: what do you do when you are going on a vacation?\\nYou first decide on a destination and then the budget. Following this, you book tickets and stay and look for places of interest that you would go to.\\nI don’t think any of us step out of the house without knowing the destination. We don’t pack our bags, then go to the airport and then start looking for tickets to some place where we can spend time holidaying.\\nSame is with financial planning.\\nWithout a financial plan, investing is like shooting arrows in the dark.\\nEven if you do your SIPs diligently and have a long-term focus, you won’t know how much to save for which goal without a financial plan.\\nYou won’t know whether your SIP amount is enough, if you need to increase it, and by how much.\\nAnother issue is that you won’t have an exit plan, which can delay your goals. That’s because markets don’t know which year you need the money for the purpose you are saving. They will crash at their whim.\\nLet me explain with an example. Suppose you started investing in 2010 in equities, and then in November 2019, you decided to buy a house. By the time you finalized a house, it was March. But markets crashed due to COVID-19. And since your entire money was in equity, a large chunk of your gains would have been wiped away, forcing you to delay buying a house till your investments recover.\\nSo, to avoid such negative surprises at a time when you can afford them the least, it’s better to have a financial plan in place.\\nFinancial planning has other hidden benefits:\\nIt provides a sense of direction and purpose.\\nIt keeps you on track.\\nIt provides measurable steps. And what gets measured gets done.\\nIt helps you stay focused and motivated.\\nInterestingly, a financial plan doesn’t start with investing.\\nIt starts with building a sufficient emergency fund, which should be equal to 6 to 12 months of your expenses.\\nThen come health insurance and life insurance. Adequate insurance acts as a shield against life’s uncertainties.\\nThen comes investing.\\nHow much you need to invest will depend on how much you want to accumulate and what the rate of return and inflation are.\\n\\nIt’s important to get these numbers right if you want to create a robust financial plan for yourself.\\nLet’s now talk about other mistakes that you should avoid while investing in mutual funds.\\n6. Other mutual fund mistakes\\nSo, above, we have covered the key mistakes that investors make while investing in mutual funds.\\nHowever, there are some others too, and you may already be aware of a few of them. Yet it’s worth revisiting them.\\nRegular plans entail distributor commission, and because of this, the fund house has to incur higher expenses. These higher expenses translate into a higher cost you have to pay, which ultimately leads to lower returns\\nOn the other hand, direct plans don’t have commissions involved and so investing in them is more rewarding than its regular plan.\\nSee the table on your screen. It mentions the difference between the returns of direct and regular plans across categories. And how investing in direct plans can boost your final corpus\\n\\n| nan             |   Return – direct plan (% pa) |   Worth of Rs 1 lakh (Rs) |   Return – regular plan (% pa) |   Worth of Rs 1 lakh (Rs) |   Difference in corpus (Rs) |\\n|:----------------|------------------------------:|--------------------------:|-------------------------------:|--------------------------:|----------------------------:|\\n| Small-cap       |                         22.58 |                    766029 |                          21.36 |                    692882 |                       73148 |\\n| Mid-cap         |                         20.69 |                    655715 |                          19.5  |                    593793 |                       61922 |\\n| Large & mid-cap |                         17.62 |                    506705 |                          16.38 |                    455778 |                       50927 |\\n| Multi-cap       |                         18.41 |                    541701 |                          17.42 |                    498411 |                       43291 |\\n| Large-cap       |                         14.83 |                    398571 |                          13.7  |                    361042 |                       37529 |\\nNow you can invest in direct plans at zero cost on ET Money. You can map your existing portfolio on the ET Money app and also convert your regular plan investments into direct plan ones.\\nThe next point is investing in the IDCW option.\\nFormerly called the ‘dividend’ option, IDCW stands for ‘income distribution cum capital withdrawal’. It is an option that AMCs provide if you need payouts from your funds.\\nSEBI changed the names of these plans as their payouts aren’t really dividends. What you get is part of your capital and part of your returns back. Hence, the name IDCW.\\nShould you invest in this option? Well, no. The growth option is better as it helps in better compounding of capital.\\nPlus, the payouts from IDCW are irregular and may be insufficient. They are completely at the AMCs’ discretion.\\nIDCW payouts are also taxed at your applicable slab. So, if you are in the highest tax slab, more than a third of the payout will be gone in tax.\\nThe next point is investing in NFOs.\\nIn a new fund offer or an NFO, a fund house raises money from investors for a new fund.\\nNFOs tend to have a low net asset value or NAV, such as Rs 10. Some investors mistakenly believe that a low NAV means a cheap fund, and it will lead to better returns.\\nFirst, one should avoid investing in NFOs as these funds don’t have a history. It’s always better to go with a fund that has proved its worth across market phases.\\nSecond, don’t think that a low NAV means a cheap fund. NAV itself doesn’t make a fund cheap or expensive.\\nNeither should you compare a low NAV with a high NAV of another fund and think there is kan ample scope for the NAV to grow.\\nThe NAVs of the two funds are not comparable.\\nIt’s not the NAV but the change in NAV that contributes to your returns.\\nLet’s now quickly talk about the next mistake: investing your short-term money in equity.\\nWhen the markets are in a bull phase, many investors want to ride the wave.\\nSome investors also see the historical short-term returns of funds and get carried away by their one-year or three-year returns.\\nRemembering that past performance doesn’t guarantee future returns is worthwhile.\\nAlso, one should see the worst performance of a fund over one-year, three-year or such periods to get an idea about what they can lose.\\nSee the chart below. It shows how many times various indices made a loss over a one-year period.\\nWhile Nifty 50’s numbers still look respectable, mid-and small-caps exhibit a higher chance of giving you a loss in the short term.\\nWith small caps, it’s almost one-third probability.\\nSo, never invest in equity for the short term. Keep at least a five-year horizon. It’s better to keep a seven-year horizon for riskier categories like mid-cap and small-cap.\\nKeeping this horizon will ensure a good return experience from equity.\\nIf you are able to avoid the above mistakes, you improve the probability of you doing good in the markets improves significantly.\\nTo help you in your journey, we have a comprehensive portfolio health check-up available on our app. The best part?

It allows you to invest a set amount in a mutual fund plan at regular intervals such as weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually.\\xa0\\nSIP amounts can vary depending on the policies of the fund house and the type of mutual fund you have selected to invest in.
